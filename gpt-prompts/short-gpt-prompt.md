Hello. I would like you to help me format an article into Markdown, for use in Docusaurus. Docusaurus, as a React framework, has many ways it can render content, but I want to use specific methods, for consistency.

I want to match the original article in terms of layout and design. Here are some examples of what I mean:

- If there is a table in the original, create the table in Markdown, **not in HTML**.  
- If there are tabs in the original, follow the instructions below for creating tabs; **do not create a different type of table in HTML or JavaScript**.
- if there is a drop-down, or accordion, or details section, please follow Docusaurus' instructions for that.

If there is a feature in the original which is not supported by either native Markdown or Docusaurus, please build your own version of it using JavaScript, JSX, or HTML, and if necessary, indicate that the file should be saved as .mdx, rather than .md.

One important note: Some articles I will send you may be long. If the article that you are going to return to me is longer than your rate limit, please send as much as you can in the first message, then deliver the rest of the article, formatted according to these instructions, in a second message.

Once you have received and processed these instructions, please tell me you are ready for me to provide the article, and I will paste it into the chat.

Formatting methods begin here:

## Specific instructions

Please make sure to follow these instructions when formatting articles:

### Closing tags as per JSX syntax rules
JSX, as used by Docusaurus, has stricter rules about closing certain HTML tags. For example, make sure you close <img>, <p>, and any other tag you open.

### Omitting font families
I will be asking you to convert articles into Markdown from HTML, which was generated by Zendesk. Zendesk uses a number of fonts which I will not be using in Docusaurus. Therefore, I *do not want them in the code you produce*. 

For example, if you see a segment like:
```
<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">zkSync Era.</span>
```

Please render it like:
```
<span>zkSync Era.</span>
```

### Preferred image link format

Replace any link to an image, regardless of its original format, with this format, retaining the name and path, if available, of the original image file:

```
<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-medium">
    <img
      src="/img/path"
      alt=""
    />
  </div>
</div>

```
Additionally, make sure that the file names of the images do not contain whitespace or capital letters; each word should be separated by a dash. For example, not like this:

```
"/img/web3-native/mmi-safe/Manage Extensions.png"

```

Rather, like this:

```
"/img/web3-native/mmi-safe/manage-extensions.png"
```

### Creating tabbed content

Tabs are very important in the articles we're converting. Please use Docusaurus' code for this; here is the sample code snippet:

```
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple">This is an apple 🍎</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">This is an orange 🍊</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">This is a banana 🍌</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
### Front matter
If the article provided to you has an H1 title, please take that title and make front matter out of it, according to Docusaurus' specifications below. **Do not include an 'id' field**. Here is an example:

```
# MetaMask Swaps
```

Should be rendered as:

```
---
title: MetaMask Swaps
---
```
Please keep in mind that if the title has special characters, such as quotation marks, apostrophes, hyphens, dashes, numerical or characters like `!$%^&`, the entire title should be put into single quotation marks, like so:

```
---
title: 'MetaMask Swaps-Verse'
---
```
# Code blocks

If there is a code block, the following should be imported into the document:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

## Syntax highlighting {#syntax-highlighting}

Code blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. You may check out [this reference](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) for the specifications of MDX.

````md
```js
console.log('Every repo must come with a mascot.');
```
````

Use the matching language meta string for your code block, and Docusaurus will pick up syntax highlighting automatically, powered by [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<BrowserWindow>

```js
console.log('Every repo must come with a mascot.');
```

</BrowserWindow>


# Admonitions

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

In addition to the basic Markdown syntax, we have a special admonitions syntax by wrapping text with a set of 3 colons, followed by a label denoting its type.

Example:

```md
:::note

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::tip

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::info

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::warning

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::danger

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

:::note

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::tip

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::info

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::warning

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::danger

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

</BrowserWindow>
```
## Specifying title {#specifying-title}

You may also specify an optional title.

```md
:::note[Your Title **with** some _Markdown_ `syntax`!]

Some **content** with some _Markdown_ `syntax`.

:::
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

:::note[Your Title **with** some _Markdown_ `syntax`!]

Some **content** with some _Markdown_ `syntax`.

:::

</BrowserWindow>
```

## Nested admonitions {#nested-admonitions}

Admonitions can be nested. Use more colons `:` for each parent admonition level.

```md
:::::info Parent

Parent content

::::danger Child

Child content

:::tip Deep Child

Deep child content

:::

::::

:::::
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

:::::info Parent

Parent content

::::danger Child

Child content

:::tip Deep Child

Deep child content

:::

::::

:::::

</BrowserWindow>
```

## Admonitions with MDX {#admonitions-with-mdx}

You can use MDX inside admonitions too!

```jsx
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::tip[Use tabs in admonitions]

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple">This is an apple 🍎</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">This is an orange 🍊</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">This is a banana 🍌</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

:::tip[Use tabs in admonitions]

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple">This is an apple 🍎</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">This is an orange 🍊</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">This is a banana 🍌</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

</BrowserWindow>
```

## Usage in JSX {#usage-in-jsx}

Outside of Markdown, you can use the `@theme/Admonition` component to get the same output.

```jsx title="MyReactPage.jsx"
import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

export default function MyReactPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Admonition type="info">
        <p>Some information</p>
      </Admonition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The types that are accepted are the same as above: `note`, `tip`, `danger`, `info`, `warning`. Optionally, you can specify an icon by passing a JSX element or a string, or a title:

```jsx title="MyReactPage.jsx"
<Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Did you know...">
  Use plugins to introduce shorter syntax for the most commonly used JSX
  elements in your project.
</Admonition>
```

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>
  <Admonition type="tip" icon="💡" title="Did you know...">
    Use plugins to introduce shorter syntax for the most commonly used JSX
    elements in your project.
  </Admonition>
</BrowserWindow>
```
