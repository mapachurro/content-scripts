<h4><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: This article describes the process for moving assets you hold in MetaMask to the Binance centralized exchange (CEX).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are trying to transfer assets to Binance from MetaMask, please make sure you are following the guidelines to avoid a loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, you have to understand that Binance is a centralized exchange that functions on a limited number of networks. </span><strong>(Ethereum mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.)</strong> S<span style="font-weight: 400;">o please make sure you're certain of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network your tokens are currently on (the one you're sending from)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for that network on the Binance exchange.Â </span></li>
</ul>
<div class="callout callout--danger">
<h4 class="callout__title">Warning</h4>
<p>If you've already sent the tokens and Binance does not support the network, your funds are most likely gone for good. For further information, please contact Binance at <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support">https://www.binance.com/en/support</a><strong>. </strong></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure that Binance supports the network, you will need to make sure that you have funds in MetaMask for gas fees <em>on that network</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that gas fees are paid in the native token of the network, for example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH for Ethereum Mainnet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNB for Binance Smart Chain</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC for Polygon.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don't have tokens for the gas fees, you won't be able to send the assets to the Binance exchange.</span></p>
