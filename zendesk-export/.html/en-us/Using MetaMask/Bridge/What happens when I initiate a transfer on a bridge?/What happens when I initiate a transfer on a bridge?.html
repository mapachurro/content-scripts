<strong>Source network transaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You sign a transaction to deposit your tokens into the bridge on the source network. The cost of the transaction—which is the only one you’ll need to sign in the bridging process—is: transfer amount + bridge provider fees + gas fees + the MetaMask fee (for more on fees, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/10056707767963" target="_self">here</a>). </span>

<strong>Destination network transaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The bridge provider will initiate the transaction on the destination network once the transaction in step 2 has been validated. You don’t need to pay for this step, as its costs are usually covered by the fees you’ve paid in step 2.</span>
