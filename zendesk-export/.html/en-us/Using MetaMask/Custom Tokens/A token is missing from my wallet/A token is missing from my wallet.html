<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you or someone else recently transferred a token to your MetaMask wallet and you don't see it in MetaMask, please check the following: <br></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>How long has it been</strong>? While blockchain transactions are fast, they are generally not instantaneous. It may be that the transaction is not complete yet. <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611" target="_self">Check on a block explorer</a>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Are you on the<a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612" target="_self"> correct network</a></strong>?
<ul>
<li>If you sent the token on an EVM-compatible network that you can use in MetaMask (e.g. BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche C-Chain, etc.), simply change networks in MetaMask.</li>
<li>If the token was not sent on an EVM-compatible network, your funds may be lost. See our <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/9370013370139" target="_self">article here</a> for more information. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Have you <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031" target="_self">added the token</a> to your wallet</strong>? MetaMask only automatically detects tokens in some circumstances. If the token isn't automatically detected, you may need to add it manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your token is displayed in your wallet but with the wrong amount, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360028059272" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p>You could also try viewing your account through <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/" target="_self">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, which detects most tokens automatically. </p>
