<p>You can now view your DeFi (<a href="https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/finance-decentralized">decentralized finance</a>) positions in the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard.</p>
<p>The DeFi dashboard is currently <strong>available on Ethereum mainnet</strong> only. Supported protocols include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aave</li>
<li>Curve</li>
<li>Stargate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Positions on any other network and any other protocols will not display. We'll expand support for the DeFi dashboard as soon as possible.</p>
<p>To access the DeFi dashboard, head to your dashboard page at <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/">portfolio.metamask.io</a>. If you already have your wallet connected to the dapp, you'll see a <strong>DeFi tab</strong> immediately underneath your portfolio value and alongside other tabs for tokens, NFTs, and transactions:</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you haven't already connected your wallet, follow <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324584621083">this guide</a>. If you just want to watch accounts, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324454669339">here</a>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Once you're on the DeFi dashboard, you'll see your positions. Using <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">Vitalik</a> as an example (I'm sure he won't mind), here's how your positions might look:</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You can see a button linking to the relevant protocol (dapp) in the first column, and then others that show the name of the position, its type, holder address, and its value.Â </p>
