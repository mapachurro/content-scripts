<p>To deposit ETH or ERC-20 tokens to your MetaMask wallet from an exchange or another wallet, you will simply need to submit a transaction pointed to the address of one of your accounts in MetaMask. <strong>Please check the exchanges that operate in your country</strong> <strong><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/#country-picker" target="_self">here</a></strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>Other considerations:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make sure the token you're trying to send is compatible with the network you're attempting to send to</strong>. For example, you could be attempting to send Polygon-native MATIC to your MetaMask, when you should be sending ERC-20 MATIC (<a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415758346267-Network-profile-Polygon-MATIC-#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20thing%20to%20bear%20in%20mind%20when%20using%20Polygon%20is%20the%20form%20taken%20by%20its%20native%20token%2C%20MATIC." target="_self">see here</a> for more info). Most of the time, exchanges will recognize that your address is incompatible with the token you're attempting to send, and prevent you from proceeding — but still, be wary. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are sending ERC-20 tokens, please review our article </span><a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031" target="_self" rel="undefined">How to display tokens in MetaMask</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to add them to the token list to see the balance of the token in your account.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process to send tokens may be different for each application that holds your tokens. We recommend that you review their documentation or contact their support team for additional help on transferring tokens from their application.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the transaction is final, the balance in your account in MetaMask should update. If the balance does not update, please check the status of your transaction on a block explorer like </span><a href="https://etherscan.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etherscan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by searching the txHash (transaction hash) of the transaction that you just submitted.</span>
