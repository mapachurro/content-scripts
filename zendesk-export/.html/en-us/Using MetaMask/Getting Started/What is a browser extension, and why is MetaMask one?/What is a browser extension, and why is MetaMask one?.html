<h3 id="01H8E5Z2BJGJG690VM63FC2R0H"><strong><span style="color: #374151;">What is a browser extension?</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">A browser extension is a<strong> small software program</strong> that integrates with your web browser to <strong>add new features</strong> or modify existing ones. Unlike standalone apps, extensions work within your browser, adding functionality and customization options specifically tailored to your browsing habits. It's like having <strong>a toolbox that works with your browser</strong>, providing you with tools to use while browsing and interacting with sites you visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">Extensions can be found in various web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. They are generally easy to install and can be accessed through the browser's extension store. After installing, they appear as icons or buttons on your browser's interface, allowing you to access their features by clicking on them.</span><span style="color: #374151;"><br></span><span style="color: #374151;"><br></span></p>

<p>As with anything you download on your device, make sure you check the source of the extension before you install it. <strong>There are bad extensions that can hurt your computer or steal your personal information.</strong> Research what you're installing and double check it's not a malicious copy, as well.</p>

<p><span style="color: #374151;">MetaMask’s extension <strong>opens up access between your web browser and decentralized applications</strong> (dApps) built on Ethereum or Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. You can think of it like this:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">Imagine if you were in one country (like the internet) and wanted to visit another country (like the Ethereum blockchain) that speaks a completely different language and has different customs. It might be hard to communicate or get around, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #374151;"><strong>MetaMask is like a friendly translator and guide</strong> who helps you navigate this new country. It understands the language and customs of both countries and helps them interact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">When you install MetaMask,<strong> it converts your web browser's language into Ethereum's</strong>, letting you do things like interact with dApps, sign transactions, and create or manage your Ethereum identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">Additionally,<strong> MetaMask acts as a wallet</strong>, meaning it keeps your digital assets safe and helps you manage transactions on the blockchain. It's like having a specialized pocket in your browser where you can securely store and access your digital assets.</span></p>
<h3 id="01H8E5Z2BKCA62B2XETD1KP794"><span style="color: #374151;">MetaMask extension is an interpreter, a tour guide, a passport (or identification), and a secure pocket, all in one. </span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #374151;">Through it, you can interact with Ethereum-compatible blockchains in a user-friendly way, working with your browser, opening up new possibilities.</span><span style="color: #374151;"><br></span></p>
