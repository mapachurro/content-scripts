<p>You can now use MetaMask Activity to review and troubleshoot your transactions on numerous EVM-compatible networks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polygon</li>
<li>Binance</li>
<li>Avalanche</li>
<li>Arbitrum</li>
<li>Palm</li>
<li>Fantom</li>
<li>Cronos.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only view transactions on <strong>one network at a time</strong>.</p>
<p>You can manually select the network for which you'd like to check your transactions by using the network selector, located next to the account address:</p>

<p>Please note that MetaMask Activity will behave differently depending on whether you have <em>connected your wallet</em> or whether you've <em>looked up</em> an account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>If you've connected your wallet, MetaMask Activity will detect your currently selected network in MetaMask</strong> and automatically display transactions on those networks — so in a lot of cases, you shouldn't have to switch manually. If your currently selected network is unsupported by MetaMask Activity, Ethereum mainnet will be selected by default. </li>
<li>
<strong>If you've searched by account address (or ENS name), MetaMask Activity will default to Ethereum mainnet</strong>. So if you want to view that account's transactions on a different network, you need to switch. </li>
</ul>
