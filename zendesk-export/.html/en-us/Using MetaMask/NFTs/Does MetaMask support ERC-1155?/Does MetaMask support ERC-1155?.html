<h4 class="callout__title">NFTs in MetaMask Portfolio</h4>
<p>Have you heard about MetaMask Portfolio? It displays all your NFTs in a consolidated portfolio view, and may mean you don't need to add them to MetaMask at all.</p>
<p>Give it a try at <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/" target="_self">portfolio.metamask.io</a> or click the link from MetaMask Extension.</p>

<p><strong>ERC-1155 tokens are supported by MetaMask Mobile and Extension</strong>, meaning your wallet can receive, store, and display assets aligned with this token standard.</p>
<p><strong>MetaMask does not yet support sending your ERC-1155 tokens</strong>, although we're working to implement this feature soon. In the meantime, we recommend you use a platform that supports ERC-1155 transfers, such as OpenSea. </p>
