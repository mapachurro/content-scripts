<h4>Did you recently acquire an NFT, and you don't see it in the relevant account?</h4>
<p>Follow the steps <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611">here</a> to look up the account on the block explorer. On the bottom half of the page, click on the tab titled "NFT Transfers"; there you should see a list of all the tokens you have in your wallet, ordered by when they entered it. If it's on Etherscan, it's in the account. <strong>For more information on making NFTs appear in MetaMask, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058238591">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h4>Did you recently sell an NFT, and you don't see a transaction in your account? </h4>
<p>Often, the process of selling an NFT is performed through a smart contract (a blockchain program), and as a result, the funds you receive are delivered to you through an <strong><em>internal transaction</em>, which do not show up in your MetaMask activity</strong>. To check internal transactions, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611" target="_self" rel="undefined">locate your account address on Etherscan</a> and about halfway down the page, click on the 'Internal Transactions' tab. The transaction should be there.</p>
<p>Another way to verify that you received funds in exchange for your NFT is by <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407623354139">verifying that your balance is correct</a>.</p>
<h2>
<br>Receiving an NFT</h2>
<p>When you buy an NFT, it's often transferred to you automatically through a marketplace. If that is not the case, please follow and double-check these steps to ensure it is a successful transaction: </p>
<ol>
<li>Provide the sender with your public address. If you need, learn how to find this <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289512" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a>
</li>
<li>Make sure you have enough of the network's native token (ETH, MATIC, BNB, etc.) to pay for gas</li>
<li>Have the sender send the NFT to your public address</li>
<li>
<a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058238591" target="_self" rel="undefined">View the NFT in MetaMask</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>As long as you're looking at the correct account in MetaMask, the NFTs should appear under the 'NFTs' tab.</p>
<p>There are a number of platforms that exist for buying and selling NFTs and, in general, ERC-721 tokens: <a href="https://niftys.com/">Nifty's</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://yh.io/">YellowHeart</a>, etc. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sending an NFT</h2>
<p>Sending an NFT (ERC-721) in MetaMask is very similar to sending conventional tokens (usually ERC-20 tokens, often just referred to as coins or crypto). </p>
<p>Please note that <strong>sending ERC-1155 NFTs is not supported in either MetaMask Extension or Mobile</strong>. See here for more information: <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058488651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Does MetaMask support ERC-1155?</a></p>
