<p>MetaMask is capable of holding, sending, and minting NFTs.</p>
<p>There are, however, some minor differences between MetaMask Mobile and Extension when interacting with NFTs: on MetaMask Mobile, you can see your NFTs in-app, while on the extension you cannot see them natively. </p>
<p>The best way MetaMask offers of viewing your NFTs is currently in MetaMask Portfolio, available at <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/" target="_self">portfolio.metamask.io</a>. All you need to do is connect your wallet, and your NFTs should be viewable. Easy!</p>
<p>Alternatively, third party websites such as Etherscan, OpenSea or Rarible may enable you to view NFTs.</p>
