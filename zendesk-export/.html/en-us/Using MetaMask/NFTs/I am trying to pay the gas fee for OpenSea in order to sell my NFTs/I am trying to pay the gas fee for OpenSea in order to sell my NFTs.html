<p>In order to pay for transactions on OpenSea, Rarible, or any other Ethereum mainnet NFT trading platform, you need to have enough ETH in your wallet to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227/preview/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6NDQwNDYwMDE3OTIyNywiZXhwIjoxNjI4MTA1MTE4fQ.XdtusXXEe7XNKJ79xgMfxknuAXklY5-RlItIsb2t_B0">pay for gas</a>. That said, there are certain circumstances where a platform, such as OpenSea, <strong>will require you to pay in WETH</strong>, which stands for "Wrapped ETH". It is a different form of ETH, created to be more compatible with newer smart contract functionality. <strong>Please consult OpenSea's documentation</strong> <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500006315941-What-are-gas-fees-on-OpenSea-">here</a> for more information on paying gas fees on the platform.</p>
