<h4 id="01GRVFY5875CRDZ9RM82HPWF8M">Managing your NFTs with MetaMask Portfolio </h4>
<p>MetaMask Portfolio is a standalone app that complements MetaMask and help you manage your tokens (and NFTs!). To see your NFTs, simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/">MetaMask Portfolio</a>
</li>
<li>Sign in with MetaMask to the address you want to see</li>
<li>Click on the "NFTs" tab</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250765073307" alt="MetaMask find NFTs portfolio"></p>
<p>All the NFTs attributable to (owned by) the accounts that you link to the dapp should be displayed automatically. Please note that not all NFTs may display correctly — this is to do with how we're able to retrieve data about them for third-party sources. We are, however, working to maximize compatibility, with the goal of making sure the vast majority of NFTs will be displayed in the dapp.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="tab is-hidden">
<p>NFTs are displayed under <strong>the NFT tab.</strong> Please remember that some NFTs will not show up on the mobile app, <strong>or may not show up correctly.</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way to display your NFTs is to turn on the app's NFT autodetect feature. See the <a href="#h_01FX57WQCNFY5GKFYR8YYW70D5" target="_self">FAQs</a> for how to do this.</p>
<p>If autodetect doesn't find your NFTs, you can add them manually using these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">
<strong>Find the NFT's <em>address.</em> </strong>On OpenSea, for example, on the NFT's page under <strong>Details</strong>, there is a blue hyperlinked value labelled 'Contract Address'. If you click on this, it will take you to the contract's address on Etherscan; at the top-left of that page, there should be an icon labelled 'Contract', and to the right, a long string of letters and numbers. This is the address of the contract that created your NFT. Click on the 'copy' icon to the right of the address, and you'll have it on your clipboard.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14277673216667" alt="Opensea find contract address" width="450" height="191"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14277673212315" alt="Polygonscan copy contract address" width="451" height="121"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>In MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'NFTs' tab in wallet view, scroll down and tap on the 'Import NFTs' link.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250780513307" alt="MetaMask find NFTs mobile" width="315" height="631"></p>
</li>
<li>Paste the NFT's address from your clipboard into the 'Address' box.</li>
<li>
<strong>Find the NFT's <em>ID</em>.</strong> A collectible's ID is a unique identifier since no two NFTs are alike. Again, on OpenSea this number is under 'Details'. Make a note of it, or copy it onto your clipboard.</li>
<li>Paste the ID into the box marked 'ID' in MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'Import' button, and your NFTs should appear under the NFTs tab.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="01GWME6RMR3E8H7B92WWD0CWMN">Displaying NFTs on Ethereum mainnet</h4>
<p>If you have automatic NFT detection enabled, MetaMask will automatically fetch any NFTs you have on <strong>Ethereum mainnet</strong>. NFTs on other networks are supported, but you need to <a href="#01GWME6RMRJS85VEE4RHHZR9Y2">add them manually</a>.</p>
<p>If you're on Ethereum mainnet and have NFT autodetect turned on, head to the 'NFTs' tab on your homepage. MetaMask will automatically display any detected NFTs.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250765080859" alt="MetaMask find NFTs extension" width="314" height="528"></p>
<p>If you don't have NFT detection turned on, you'll see a prompt under the NFTs tab that will take you to Settings &gt; Security &amp; privacy to turn it on. Head there to toggle it.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250780523163" alt="MetaMask autodetect tokens settings extension" width="315" height="529"></p>
<p>Head back to your homepage and the NFTs tab, and your collection should appear.</p>
<p>In future, if an NFT isn't detected automatically, you can manually refresh by clicking the 'Refresh list' button at the bottom of the NFTs tab.</p>
<h4 id="01GWME6RMRJS85VEE4RHHZR9Y2">Adding NFTs manually</h4>
<p>In some cases, you may want to add an NFT manually. This could be, for example, because you have NFTs on EVM-compatible chains that MetaMask supports, like Polygon or BNB Smart Chain.</p>
<p>To do this, head to the NFTs tab, scroll down and click 'Import NFTs', then input the requested information.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/18335019857947" alt="MetaMask import NFTs extension" width="315" height="529"></p>
<p>You'll be able to find these details on OpenSea by connecting your wallet and finding the NFT's details on your profile.</p>
