<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly known as Optimism, OP Mainnet is a <strong>layer 2 (L2) rollup</strong> helping to scale Ethereum. Let's unpack how it works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L2s are a type of blockchain closely linked to a corresponding layer 1 (L1), which, in this case, is Ethereum. Transactions are handled on the L2 itself, the <em>execution layer</em>, whilst data about these transactions is 'rolled up' into a condensed form and posted on L1, demanding significantly less computation than if all of the transactions were to be conducted entirely on L1. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their structure allows users access to high-capacity, fast and low-cost alternative to Ethereum mainnet whilst retaining the same fundamental mechanisms and features. Critically, L2s also inherit Ethereum's security and reliability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OP Mainnet's execution layer is called the <strong>OVM</strong>, or Optimism Virtual Machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OP Mainnet uses a system similar to Proof-of-Stake, in which entities running nodes help secure the network. In this case, they are called <strong>verifiers.</strong> Additionally, OP Mainnet requires a <strong>sequencer</strong>, responsible for collecting transactions from the L2, rolling them up, and posting them to L1 (Ethereum). The Optimism organization itself currently runs the sole sequencer on the network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name not-so-subtly hints, OP Mainnet belongs to the <strong>optimistic rollup</strong> category. Similarly to Arbitrum, one of the other major L2 platforms, OP Mainnet's protocols</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assume that all transactions are valid. This approach means that the network does not have to compute every transaction, significantly reducing congestion; instead, computation is only performed when the validity of the block is challenged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This occurs in a process referred to as a <strong>fraud proof</strong>, which is where verifiers come in: when the state information or 'commitment' (i.e. the bundle of rolled-up transactions) is posted to Ethereum, a one-week 'challenge window' begins. Verifiers check state information and are responsible for initiating a fraud proof to resolve the issue. If proven right, verifiers are rewarded and the proposed commitment is replaced with a new one. This '<a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/2-rollup-protocol/" target="_self" rel="undefined">How Optimism Works</a>' page is a good explainer if you want to find out more. </span></p>

<h4 id="h_01HE5QP37P1CKK9CABNXB6NG39" class="callout__title">Gas controls on OP Mainnet</h4>
<p>When using OP Mainnet in MetaMask, you won't be able to manually adjust the amount of gas you pay using <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972" target="_self">advanced gas controls</a>, as you would on other networks. The feature is disabled instead. This is because it's not possible for users to specify gas limits when OP Mainnet submits the transaction to Ethereum.

<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Adding a network is a straightforward process.</p>
<p>OP Mainnet is already configured as a popular network in MetaMask, so adding it is straightforward. Click 'Add network' and head to the 'Add popular networks' area (instructions <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612" target="_self">here</a>). From here, adding it to MetaMask should only take a few clicks or taps.</p>
<p>However, you can also manually input the network information above. For guidance, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC" target="_self">here</a>. </p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What token do I need?</strong></div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How do I bridge tokens onto OP Mainnet?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>OP Mainnet has an official bridge that can be accessed <a href="https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit">here</a>. Optimism have put together a step-by-step guide to using the bridge <a href="https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411894687387-Deposits-into-Optimism" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also bridge to and from OP Mainnet using MetaMask Portfolio, <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use a direct on-ramp. These platforms allow you to purchase crypto with fiat currency (e.g. dollars, euros) and have the appropriate quantity of tokens deposited into your wallet. Again, MetaMask Portfolio's <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/buy/" target="_self">Buy section</a> covers this need too. </p>
<p>A list of supported on-ramps <a href="https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413642522139" target="_self">here</a>, and you can also buy ETH on OP Mainnet directly in MetaMask Extension. Just make sure you have OP Mainnet selected as your current network and hit the 'Buy' button.

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can I use my MetaMask address?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Yes. When you add OP Mainnet to MetaMask and use MetaMask on the network, you will be using your existing MetaMask public address.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can I send tokens directly to and from OP Mainnet without bridging?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>No. Always use the bridging methods described above to get your tokens onto OP Mainnet.</p>
</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What kinds of tokens can be used on OP Mainnet?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>OP Mainnet supports its native token, Ether (ETH), as well as ERC-20 tokens. <strong>You can move any token from Ethereum to OP Mainnet, provided it exists on both networks.</strong></p>
<p>However, an ERC-20 token on Ethereum is not interchangeable with an ERC-20 token on OP Mainnet. <strong>They must be bridged first</strong>, and you must ensure the token is supported on OP Mainnet before trying to bridge it over.</p>
<p>This is because ERC-20 tokens are essentially created by smart contracts. If a token exists on Ethereum it will have a corresponding token (contract) address. This same logic applies to OP Mainnet: so if there is no contract address for a token on OP Mainnet, you cannot move that token to the network.</p>
<p>To get around this potential barrier, it's best to stick to using the Optimism bridge, which will only allow you to transfer the token if it is supported on OP Mainnet.</p>
<p>Since OP Mainnet is a L2 rather than a conventional EVM-compatible network (such as Binance Chain or Avalanche C-Chain), you cannot move tokens from these networks onto OP Mainnet, even if they have an ERC-20-equivalent standard (such as BEP-20). You must go via Ethereum mainnet.</p>
