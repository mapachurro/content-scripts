<p>Palm is an EVM-based sidechain developed <strong>specifically for selling, buying, and trading NFTs</strong> (non-fungible tokens). Built as a destination blockchain for NFT creators, artists, and collectors, the network seeks to present an alternative to Ethereum's congestion and high fees, whilst retaining interoperability and keeping these creators, creations, and buyers within the Ethereum ecosystem, rather than see them emigrating to other layer-1 blockchains with growing NFT communities.</p>
<p>To make the transition from Ethereum to Palm as seamless as possible, the Palm team ensured their network has <strong>EVM-compatibility</strong>. Not only does this mean developers can work on Palm in the same programming language (Solidity) as they do on Ethereum, making it relatively straightforward to migrate, but it also allows MetaMask to function as a gateway to the network. </p>
<p>A <strong>proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism</strong> underpins the network. A variant of proof-of-stake (PoS), PoA assigns a limited number of validators responsibility for <em>validating </em>blocks. Each validator must stake tokens in order to obtain the <em>authority </em>to fulfil this role. If they perform their duties correctly, they receive rewards; but if they do not submit valid blocks, their stake is 'slashed' (taken from them).</p>
<p>This mechanism provides Palm with the ability to cheaply process high volumes of transactions, and reduces its environmental impact due to the superior energy efficiency of PoS (and variants) relative to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489611#:~:text=Under%20PoW%20consensus,helps%20the%20network." target="_self">proof-of-work</a> (PoW). Palm is <a href="https://palm.io/#:~:text=99.9%25%20More,Proof%20of%20Stake." target="_self"><strong>99.9% more energy-efficient</strong></a> than PoW networks. It is hoped that this will help attract artists and creators to the Ethereum NFT space who were previously reluctant due to environmental concerns.</p>
<p>In the long run, the Palm team intends to transition from a sidechain to a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-l222-means-for-the-ethereum-ecosystem/" target="_self">layer-2 (L2)</a> network, since the Merge on Ethereum mainnet negated one of the key drivers behind Palm's current configuration. The team also says its roadmap includes the addition of a governance system, supported by its native token, PALM. </p>
<p>To enhance its pull as a creator-driven NFT community, Palm takes an interesting approach to the availability of the PALM token. It is<strong> only available via airdrop</strong> when you interact with the network in various ways. For a full overview of how you can get PALM, see <a href="https://palm.io/get-palm/" target="_self">here</a>. </p>

<h2><strong>Using Palm</strong></h2>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How do I add Palm to MetaMask?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Palm is already configured as a popular network in MetaMask, so adding it is straightforward. Click 'Add network' and head to the 'Add popular networks' area (instructions <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612" target="_self">here</a>). From here, adding it to MetaMask should only take a few clicks or taps.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can head to <a href="https://app.palm.io/configure">app.palm.io/configure</a> and follow the prompts, or add it manually using the instructions <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a> and the network details at the top of this article.</p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What are PALM tokens for?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>As the native token of the network, you need PALM in order to pay for transactions. PALM is not used for buying/selling NFTs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How do I get PALM tokens?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>As detailed <a href="https://palm.io/get-palm/">here</a>, PALM is only available via airdrops which are awarded based on users' interactions with the network.</p>
<p>The airdrops provide users with enough tokens to use the network, and in quantities proportionate to how much value they bring: i.e. the more NFTs you buy and sell on Palm-supported marketplaces (see <em>Does Palm have an NFT marketplace?</em>), the more PALM you will accumulate.</p>
<p>Part of the network's roadmap involves establishing a governance system in future. This will allow PALM holders to have a say in how the network is run and developed -- and the more PALM you hold, the more weight your contributions will have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Does Palm have an NFT marketplace?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>No. Palm is a blockchain, not a marketplace (e.g. like OpenSea).</p>
<p>Instead, Palm supports marketplaces and NFT platforms that are built on its network. Examples include <a href="https://niftys.com/" target="_self">Nifty's</a>, <a href="https://portion.io/" target="_self">Portion</a>, and <a href="https://www.heni.com/" target="_self">Heni</a>.</p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How do I get tokens and NFTs on to Palm?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Head to the Palm platform at <a href="https://app.palm.io/">app.palm.io</a>. At the top of the screen you'll see links to <strong>Token Bridge</strong> and <strong>NFT Bridge</strong>. Pick the option which corresponds to your intention.</p>
<div class="tabs tabs--colored-1">
<div class="tabs-menu">
<span class="tabs-link is-active">Bridging tokens</span> <span class="tabs-link">Bridging NFTs</span>
</div>
<div class="tab">Currently, you can only bridge three tokens to Palm:
<ul>
<li>WETH (wrapped ETH, commonly used on NFT platforms)</li>
<li>DAI, a stablecoin</li>
<li>PRT, an ERC-20 token distributed by and usable on the Portion platform. You can read more about it <a href="https://medium.com/portion/announcing-the-portion-token-85efa049e7e0">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bridging tokens over can be useful primarily for buying NFTs on Palm-supported marketplaces.</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<h4 class="callout__title">How do I transfer tokens from Palm to Ethereum?</h4>
<p>By default, the Palm bridge will assume you are transferring from the network your MetaMask is currently connected to. So if you load the page whilst MetaMask is connected to Ethereum, it will assume you want to bridge to Palm. To change, click the switch icon where the networks are listed, change your network in MetaMask to Palm, and then reload the bridge page.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you've connected your wallet, the token platform will look like the below:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16422656718491" alt="Palm network bridging tokens" width="450" height="554"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Simply select the token you want to transfer over and input the amount you want to move. The receiving address needs to be a wallet compatible with the Palm network -- currently, MetaMask is your only option.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Once you've clicked 'Start transfer' you'll be prompted to confirm it in MetaMask. Then, pending completion of the transaction, the tokens will be in your wallet. If they don't appear, make sure you've <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-add-unlisted-tokens-custom-tokens-in-MetaMask">added the token</a> to your MetaMask.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab is-hidden">
<p>The NFT bridge on Palm should look something like below:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16422656718875" alt="Palm network bridging NFTs" width="450" height="734"></p>
<p>Input your NFT's details to start with, and you'll get a preview of the asset you want to move to help confirm that it's the correct one.</p>
<p>When you've checked the transaction fee (displayed at the bottom of the screen) and you're happy to proceed, hit 'Start transfer' to get going, and then confirm the transaction in MetaMask.</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Using the Palm on-ramp</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>On-ramps are platforms which enable you to directly purchase tokens using fiat currency, such as dollars or euros, and have them immediately deposited into your wallet on a given network.</p>
<p>In Palm's case, you can buy DAI tokens on their on-ramp platform <a href="https://app.palm.io/onramp" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a>.</p>
