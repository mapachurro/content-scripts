<h3 class="note-title">Potential Loss of Assets</h3>
<p>Transferring assets between blockchains is not necessarily a simple task. Some tokens cannot be sent from one network to another — and if you do, <strong>you can lose them forever</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is a bridge?</h2>
<p>A bridge is an app that allows you to transfer assets (cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other tokens) between one blockchain and another. For example, transferring from BSC (now BNB Chain) to Ethereum.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16533744376603" alt="BNB ETH bridge diagram" width="601" height="262"></p>
<h2>Why do I need to use a bridge?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many users use the same address on multiple blockchains, for example by <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612" target="_self">adding a blockchain connection</a> in MetaMask. What if they've got an NFT on Gnosis Chain, but they want to have it on Polygon?</li>
<li>Conversely, you might have a different address, say on BSC, than what you use on Ethereum. You may think that you can just send tokens from your BSC address directly to your Ethereum address; after all, they're both EVM-compatible, right?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Wrong. </em><strong>The BSC blockchain and Ethereum blockchains are separate networks, with no built-in knowledge of each other. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">If you send to your Ethereum address from BSC, BSC will send to the address you put in, but </span><em>on the BSC network. </em><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">For more information on this specific scenario, </span><a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance">see here</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p>
<h2>What bridge should I use?</h2>
<div class="callout callout--info">
<h4 class="callout__title">MetaMask Bridge</h4>
<p>You can now access a curated, straightforward bridging experience in MetaMask Bridge, available at <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/" target="_self">portfolio.metamask.io</a>, or by clicking the 'Bridge' button in MetaMask Extension. Only certain tokens and network combinations are available initially.</p>
</div>
<p>You should choose a bridge primarily based on what you're trying to move, where. For example, some bridges only move ERC-20 (currency) tokens; others specifically handle ERC-721 and 1155 (NFTs). The last thing you want to do is try to transfer tokens to a different network, and never receive them.</p>
<h3>There is no definitive listing of bridges.</h3>
<p>This is Web3, which is based around permissionless, open development; this means that at any given time, there might be a new bridge between networks. There are also <strong>bridge aggregators</strong>, which are platforms that allow you to use several bridges in conjunction, conveniently transferring assets across platforms.</p>

<h2>How does a bridge work?</h2>
<p>There are a number of different mechanisms that bridges use to move assets between networks; often, they are centralized entities that operate almost like an exchange. Others are more decentralized. If you're interested in the nuts and bolts, start with ethereum.org's <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/bridges/">documentation here</a>.</p>
<h2>I need step-by-step instructions on how to use a bridge</h2>
<p>Given the above-mentioned wide variety in bridge platforms, networks, and functionality, we can't provide a step-by-step that will work for <em>every</em> bridge. In general, though, this is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the bridge that you have identified will work for your particular combination of networks and token types</li>
<li>Log in to the app with your MetaMask wallet</li>
<li>Choose the network you're going <em>from</em> and <em>to</em>
</li>
<li>Choose the asset you want to transfer
<ul>
<li>During these steps, you may need to sign approvals in your MetaMask Wallet. <em>Make sure you read every transaction or approval you make carefully. </em>For more on approvals, <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/the-seal-of-approval-know-what-youre-consenting-to-with-permissions-and-approvals-in-metamask/" target="_self">see here</a> or <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683" target="_self">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initiate the bridging process</li>
<li>WAIT
<ul>
<li>Bridging generally is not instantaneous, and can often take five to ten minutes for the transaction to be fully processed on the first chain, and then the second chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open your wallet on the second chain (If you're managing both chain's assets in MetaMask, make sure you switch networks in MetaMask!) and verify the assets are present; remember, you may need to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031">add the tokens to be able to see them</a>.</li>
</ul>
