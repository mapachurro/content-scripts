<p>MetaMask makes dapp adoption quick and easy because we host a blockchain connection by default, and our trusty friends at Infura do an amazing job making this experience feel totally seamless, <a href="https://status.infura.io/" target="_self">almost all of the time</a>!</p>
<p>Sometimes, some dapp usage has grown much faster than we've been able to anticipate, and so MetaMask's default provider connection can become intermittent. Sometimes we have to limit abusive sites.</p>
<p>At times like that, there are three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait and be patient.</li>
<li>Connect to another blockchain provider in place of Infura (like <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015290012-Using-a-Local-Node" target="_self" rel="undefined">your own local node</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">)</span>
</li>
<li>Use another client.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Connecting to another blockchain provider</h2>
<p>To connect, you'll need to run a local RPC server, and then connect to it in MetaMask as if you were selecting a network. On both Extension and Mobile, the network selector is at the top of the screen, in the middle.</p>
