<h3>As discussed in a Consensys blog post on <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/to-infinity-and-beyond-the-growth-of-axie-infinity/" target="_self">Axie Infinity</a>, the Ronin <strong>sidechain</strong> has become very popular, and MetaMask wants our users to be able to interact safely and reliably with the Ronin chain.</h3>

<p>Axie Infinity runs on the sidechain Ronin, and not Ethereum mainnet. For more information, see <a href="https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for interacting with the Ronin network using MetaMask:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the Ronin wallet address for sending assets directly from MetaMask, simply changing the "ronin" prefix into "0x" or vice versa, <strong>you will lose any assets you send.</strong>
</li>
<li>The transfer of assets from MetaMask to the Ronin wallet and vice versa <strong>must be made with the Bridge app</strong> (<a href="https://bridge.axieinfinity.com/">https://bridge.axieinfinity.com/</a>).</li>
<li>If the assets were transferred directly from MetaMask and not using the Bridge app, <strong>there is no way we can reverse the transaction</strong>, as the nature of blockchains does not allow it.</li>
<li>If the assets have been sent through the bridge but are not reflected in the Ronin wallet after a reasonable amount of time, <strong>you should address this with Ronin's customer support, as this is not a MetaMask product</strong>.</li>
<li>As always, <strong>never give your seed phrase or secret recovery phrase to anyone, even if you believe that person to be Customer Support from MetaMask, Axie Infinity, or Ronin.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
