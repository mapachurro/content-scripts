<p>To keep your computer and its contents as safe as possible from someone with physical access to your machine, we recommend you enable full disk encryption on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On a Mac this is the </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FileVault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Windows, you should enable </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BitLocker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Linux, you can use </span><a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/disk-encryption-luks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LUKS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this safety.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With full disk encryption, an attacker with physical access to your computer should not be able to extract any of its contents, including any private keys you have stored throughout your disk, but also site passwords, banking details, and other sensitive information.</span></p>
