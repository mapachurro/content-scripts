<p>For a fuller discussion of MetaMetrics, our most updated blog post on the topic is <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/metametrics-a-refresher-on-metamasks-analytics-system-78d725cb9a75">here</a>; simply put, <strong>MetaMetrics is an opt-in analytics platform that aims to collect information on non-sensitive user events to help us improve the software for MetaMask users. </strong></p>
<p>MetaMask is a product that, above all else, values our users' privacy and agency: MetaMask is a tool built to empower you, not to profit off of you. While many software products, with the best of intentions, have built-in metrics collection tools that are not visible to the user, MetaMask's metrics collection is completely voluntary. </p>
<p>That said, opting into MetaMetrics doesn't affect your experience negatively at all--and in fact, it increases the likelihood that features you want or need will be prioritized. By opting in, users help us answer questions such as:</p>
<ul class="">

<li id="ff62" class="lt lu iw kz b la mc ld md lg me lk mf lo mg ls ly lz ma mb fy" data-selectable-paragraph="">Where do people drop off when completing certain actions?</li>
</ul>
<p>To those of you who do opt-in: thank you for helping us make MetaMask better!</p>
