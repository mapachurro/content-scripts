<p>In this situation, your wallet is most likely compromised (someone has obtained unauthorized access). The steps below outline a method for damage limitation: you may be able to rescue some funds from your account before they are removed. </p>
<h3>Follow these steps as soon as possible:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install MetaMask on another browser (or <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-to-manage-multiple-wallets-with-metamask/" target="_self">another browser profile</a>). For Mobile, you'll need a second device, enabling you to create a new instance of MetaMask (if you remove MetaMask from your mobile device and you don't have the <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432" target="_self">Secret Recovery Phrase backed up</a>, you won't be able to re-access it). </li>
<li>
<strong>Create a new MetaMask wallet</strong> on the new browser, browser profile, or mobile device.</li>
<li>Write down the Secret Recovery Phrase in the correct order and store it someplace safe. <strong>Never give it to anyone</strong>.</li>
<li>Go back to the compromised account and <strong>send any remaining funds to the newly created account</strong>. If you believe there may be a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12091923128347" target="_self">sweeper script</a> on the compromised account, don't send in any additional ETH or other tokens to pay for gas (if there is a sweeper, try following our guidance <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/5716855323675" target="_self">here</a>). </li>
<li>Once you've removed all of the funds you can, <strong>discontinue using the old wallet </strong>and any accounts associated with the compromised Secret Recovery Phrase.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/5168786362779" target="_self">Report the scam </a>to the relevant authorities.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red90"><strong>Unfortunately, transactions cannot be reversed, nor missing funds restored. MetaMask is a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212" target="_self">self-custodial wallet</a>, which means we cannot control access to user accounts, nor intervene and rescue your account or funds for you.</strong></span></p>
<h2><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Why did this happen? </span></strong></h2>
