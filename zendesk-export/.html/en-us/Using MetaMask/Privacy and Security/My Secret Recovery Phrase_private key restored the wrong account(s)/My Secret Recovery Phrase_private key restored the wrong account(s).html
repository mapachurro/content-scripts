<p>Assuming you are using the correct Secret Recovery Phrase (which can restore multiple accounts) or private key (which can restore only one account when <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331" target="_self">imported</a>), it is impossible to restore the wrong account(s). Check to see if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<p>If you are encountering this problem, the most common reasons are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) you currently have is not the one that restores the account you are looking for. </strong>In other words: you have the wrong SRP. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The account you are missing was a secondary account created under the SRP you currently have.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To check if that is the case, use <a href="https://danfinlay.github.io/mnemonic-account-generator/">https://danfinlay.github.io/mnemonic-account-generator/</a> to generate 10 to 100 accounts and check if the missing accounts are in that list. (Bear in mind that the generator will produce account addresses <em>without </em>the 0x at the start, so copying an address from elsewhere that <em>does </em>have the 0x prefix will produce no matches.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the account you're looking for is a secondary account, you can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recreate it in MetaMask by following the instructions <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271" target="_self">here</a>.<br></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The SRP you have was originally generated by a different wallet provider.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think this could be the case, try restoring your account using that wallet to check if you get access to the missing account.<br></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The missing account was imported using a private key. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what is known as an <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289932-What-are-imported-accounts-" target="_self">imported account</a>. </span>In this case, the only way to access the account is to reimport it using the private key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The SRP was written down wrong or is being entered incorrectly when restoring.</strong></p>
<p>One frequent problem is poor handwriting when writing down the SRP; another is writing the words in the <em>wrong order. </em>The words must be in the order in which they were originally presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The SRP is actually restoring the account, but what is missing is the custom tokens that need to be re-added.  </strong></p>
<p>You can follow the steps <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-and-Custom-Tokens-in-Metamask">here</a> to re-add them.</p>
