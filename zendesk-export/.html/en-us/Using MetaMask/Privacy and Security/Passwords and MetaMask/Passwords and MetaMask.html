<p>MetaMask uses passwords in a way that you may not be used to. This mainly has to do with the fact that <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212">MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet</a> (also called non-custodial, though we're phasing out this term); it's <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not</strong></span> a conventional cloud-based app where we keep track of your username and password.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> keep track of your <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107">Secret Recovery Phrase</a>, and each time you <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612">restore your wallet using your Secret Recovery Phrase</a>, <em><strong>you set the password for that specific instance of MetaMask.</strong></em><br><strong>This means that if you use different passwords for each instance</strong> (Mobile, Extension, Extension on different computers or browser profiles), <strong>you need to remember which password you used for each instance.</strong></p>
