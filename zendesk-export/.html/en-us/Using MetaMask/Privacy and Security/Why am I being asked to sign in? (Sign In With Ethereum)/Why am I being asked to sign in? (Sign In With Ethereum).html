Identity providers such as Apple, Facebook, or Google hold sufficient personal information to be able to prove, theoretically, that it's <em>you </em>who is interacting with a product or service online. This is why you often have the option to create accounts and log into websites using their identity services (single sign-on/SSO services).</span></span></p>

<h3>How does it look in MetaMask?</h3>
<p>SIWE is a feature that developers can choose to make available to users of their dapps. Accordingly, you won't find it on every dapp you visit, but only on those where it's implemented. </p>
<p>Signing in with SIWE looks similar in MetaMask to many other signature requests: </p>

<p>What does this mean? Well, you're essentially just signing a transaction to demonstrate your identity. Nothing more, nothing less. Using your private key to sign a transaction proves that you're the account holder, and have the authority to use that account on the dapp. </p>
