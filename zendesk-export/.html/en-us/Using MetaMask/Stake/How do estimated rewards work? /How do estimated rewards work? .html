<p>When viewing your holdings, you'll see two variants of estimated rewards which are calculated slightly differently: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Estimated lifetime rewards</strong>: Lifetime rewards are an estimate of how many rewards you’ve received from the staking provider, calculated using a mix of on-chain data and third-party APIs. It may include rewards you may have received from holdings acquired outside of MetaMask Staking.</li>
<li>
<strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Estimated current rewards</strong><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">: Current rewards is the percentage of annual rewards you are predicted to receive, subject to change, based on a provider’s performance over the last week, as calculated by each provider's API.</span>
</li>
</ul>
