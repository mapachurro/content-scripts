<p>Usually, when you intend to connect MetaMask to a dapp in a desktop browser, a pop-up will appear in MetaMask asking you to confirm the connection.</p>
<p><strong>If nothing happens, the most common reason is because you have more than one browser-based wallet installed and active</strong>. <strong>You'll need to disable other wallets in order for MetaMask to work properly. </strong></p>
<p>To do this, head to your browser's extension manager and find the on/off toggle next to the other wallet's extension. It should look like this:</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Once you have disabled other wallets, reload the page</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Depending on your browser, managing extensions can work a little differently. To find the correct page, copy the appropriate link into your address bar:</p>
