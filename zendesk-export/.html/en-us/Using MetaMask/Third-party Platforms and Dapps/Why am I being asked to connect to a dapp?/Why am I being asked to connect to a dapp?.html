<p>For sites to see your wallet address, they must ask you for access. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">All they're gaining in these situations is the ability to see your address, and, by extension (since everything is viewable on the blockchain), the funds you hold.</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> <strong>This does not mean they can access and move your tokens around</strong> — for that, you'll need to sign a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683" target="_self">token approval</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span></p>
<p>You will only be required to connect to a dapp once. After that, you'll be able to see it in your 'Connected sites'. For more detail on viewing connected sites and for how to disconnect from them, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059535551" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p>Some legacy sites may not request access properly. If you go to a dapp and it does not see your wallet, you'll need to <strong>add it manually</strong>. See our <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045901112" target="_self">article</a> for how to do this. </p>
