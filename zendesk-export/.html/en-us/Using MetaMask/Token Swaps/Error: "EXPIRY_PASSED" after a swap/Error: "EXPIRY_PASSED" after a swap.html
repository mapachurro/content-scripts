<p>If you try to swap using MetaMask Swaps and your swap fails, you could see this error message on the block explorer:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/11992991758235" alt="EXPIRY_PASSED.png" width="700" height="133"></p>
<p>This happens either when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You waited too long in MetaMask to perform the swap, or;</li>
<li>You submitted the swap right as the quotes were about to refresh. </li>
</ul>
<p>Retry the attempted swap as normal, and you should no longer encounter the same error. If you do, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391" target="_self">get in touch with Support</a>. </p>
