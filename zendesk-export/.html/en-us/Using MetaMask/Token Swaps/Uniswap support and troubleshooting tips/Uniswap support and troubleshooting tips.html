<p>Answers to the most common Uniswap issues can be found on their <a href="https://uniswap.org/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ site</a>.</p>
<p>Some additional tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have enough ETH for the gas fee in order to complete the swap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you both APPROVE and then SWAP (two transactions). If you only approved, it will not be completed.</p>
</li>
<li>After the swap completes,<strong> if you do not see the tokens you swapped for</strong>, you may need to simply <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-in-Metamask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the token(s) to your MetaMask in order to see them. </a>
</li>
<li>If you are getting failed transactions, make sure the gwei is set high enough, and the gas limit is above 250,000.</li>
<li>If your MetaMask activity feed is inaccurate or stuck, meaning you are unable to speed up, cancel or send new transactions, try <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251-How-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction">these instructions</a>.</li>
<li>Never give your Secret Recovery Phrase to anyone or any site. If Uniswap asks you for this information, then you are not on Uniswap, you are on a scam site or app.</li>
