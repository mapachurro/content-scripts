<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is Smart Swaps?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>A <em>smart</em> swap is like a regular swap, with the addition of special metadata that increases your swap performance and protects you from MEV.</p>
<p>Like regular swaps, Smart Swaps are simulated by MetaMask in advance, but are further optimized so you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower network fees</li>
<li>Higher transaction success rates</li>
<li>Higher <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/">MEV</a> resistance</li>
<li>Higher transaction privacy</li>
</ul>

<div class="accordion__item-content">

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Are there risks to using Smart Swaps?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Smart Swaps is designed to be safer than regular swaps, providing additional protections against <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/">MEV</a>. While the system substantially lowers the risk of negative outcomes associated with MEV, no system can eliminate these risks entirely. For more information on the risks associated with Smart Swaps, please refer to our <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/20628953388827">risk disclosures</a>.</p>
