<h4 class="callout__title">Please note:</h4>
<p>This article is for MetaMask swaps performed with the swap button within our app or extension. <strong> For all other swap inquiries, please contact the third-party swap system you used, as they will have a better understanding of their system's intricacies, nuances, and issues.</strong></p>

<p>MetaMask Swaps is not available on every network.  If it is available on a network, the button will allow you to proceed. The team is investigating options on a path forward for additional networks. If and when that time comes, you will automatically see it reflected in the app and extension.</p>

<p>If you are on a network on which Swaps is available, but are unable to click the Swap button, try restarting your browser, or try a different network connection entirely. Sometimes toggling networks (switch from one network back to the network you were using) helps.</p>
