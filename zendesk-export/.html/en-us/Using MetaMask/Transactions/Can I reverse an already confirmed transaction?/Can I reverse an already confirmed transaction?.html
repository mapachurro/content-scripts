<p>Decentralized blockchains are immutable, meaning the data they contain cannot be changed. When the transaction is confirmed and shows as successful, <strong>there is nothing we can do to revert/cancel it.</strong> Usually, when the transaction is confirmed, it's final, and is added to the next block. </p>
<p><strong>You can only cancel a transaction while it is still pending. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We cannot revert a transaction that is already completed.</strong></p>
<p>What you can do is to check with the receiver or receiving app to see if they could do anything on their side (i.e. return your funds via a new transaction).</p>
