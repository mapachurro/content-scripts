<p>At times, you may interact with a dapp, and expect to see a transaction record in MetaMask, but you don't. Your next step, as always, should be to verify on a block explorer whether the transaction occurred. Even then, though, you might not see it, if it is an <em>internal transaction.</em></p>
<h3>So if you're looking for a transaction and don't see it anywhere, check under the 'Internal Transactions' tab in Etherscan.</h3>

<p>Here's an example of what an internal transaction looks like there:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/12927478386075" alt="Internal Transaction Example"></p>
<p><em>The actual transfer of funds shows up under the “To” field.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why aren’t <em>internal transactions</em> displayed in my wallet activity/history?</h3>
<p>When we talk about a 'transaction', we are referring to the act of an amount being deducted from one account, and that amount being added to the balance of another account: a simple transfer. However, as more sophisticated dapps are created, there are other things that happen on the blockchain that aren't "simple transfers".</p>
<p>An <em>internal transaction </em>is an action that is occurring within, or between, one or multiple smart contracts. In other words, it is initiated inside the code itself, rather than <em>externally</em>, from a wallet address controlled by a human.</p>
<p>Often, the end result of the internal transaction is that one address or another will end up with more tokens of some kind; for example, if you're minting DAI, or if you're reserving an ENS name (in the latter case, you end up with that ENS name in your wallet).</p>
<p>Currently, MetaMask does not show internal transactions in your transaction activity or history, only standard transactions between addresses.</p>
<p>That said, <strong>there is no difference between tokens received through an internal transaction, and those received through a standard transaction. </strong>The transfer of funds <strong>is</strong> <strong>reflected</strong> in the overall balance of the account.</p>
<p>The reason MetaMask does not show these internal transactions is mainly a technical one; internal transactions, being somewhat "ephemeral" in nature (they occur while the code is running), are not recorded on the blockchain. There are some services, like Etherscan, that track internal transactions.</p>
