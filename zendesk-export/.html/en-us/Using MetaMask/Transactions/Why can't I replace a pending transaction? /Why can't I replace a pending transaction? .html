<p>Pending transactions that are displaying as such on the blockchain (make sure to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611" target="_self">check a block explorer</a>) can be replaced by sending another transaction with the same nonce, using the method <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251" target="_self">here</a>. This article should be your first destination if you're looking for how to replace a pending transaction.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the most common reasons your replacement pending transaction will fail is because you <strong>already have multiple pending transactions</strong>. </p>
<p>In these cases, you need to <strong>replace the oldest transaction first, and proceed through them in reverse order </strong>(from oldest to newest). </p>
<p>Age is determined by the transaction's nonce, a unique number (<em>number used only once</em>) that is assigned to every transaction sent from your wallet. Nonces are assigned in ascending order — so the smallest pending transaction nonce you can find is the oldest. </p>

<h4 class="callout__title">How do I find pending transactions?</h4>
<p>If a transaction is pending, it will be marked as such in your MetaMask transaction history. You can also inspect your history on a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611" target="_self">block explorer</a>.</p>

<p>If you try to replace a pending transaction before resolving older outstanding pending transactions first, your new transactions will continually fail. This is because you need to resolve the oldest first. </p>
