<p>If you are using the Ethereum Mainnet, try toggling networks: switch from Ethereum mainnet to another network, and then back again.</p>
<p>Please make sure you are also on the latest version of MetaMask.</p>
<p>If you manually added the network to MetaMask, head to Settings &gt; Networks and make sure the chain ID associated with the network is the correct one. To find a chain ID, you could head to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058992772" target="_self">Chainlist</a>, which maintains a catalogue of EVM-compatible networks and their details, or search for the relevant documentation of the network itself.Â </p>
