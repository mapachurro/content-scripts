<p>This error message can be prompted because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using the wrong token address. Check <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059683451" target="_self">here</a> for guidance on how to find it.Â </li>
<li>MetaMask needs to be <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060268452" target="_self">updated to the latest version.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If these steps do not solve this issue, try reinstalling the app. Make sure you have everything backed up before proceeding: your Secret Recovery Phrase, private keys (for any imported accounts), and passwords.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do not </em></strong>uninstall the app if you don't have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up and safely recorded somewhere, otherwise you will permanently lose access to your wallet. Since MetaMask is a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212" target="_self">self-custodial</a> (non-custodial) wallet, we won't be able to help you regain access in such cases. After reinstalling, you'll need to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612" target="_self">restore your wallet</a> using your Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>
<p>For each old account that you had in your original installation, you must re-add it; see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271">here</a> for details.</p>
<p>If the token you are looking for is not found using the Search method, then you will need to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031">add it as a Custom Token</a>.<br><strong><br></strong></p>
