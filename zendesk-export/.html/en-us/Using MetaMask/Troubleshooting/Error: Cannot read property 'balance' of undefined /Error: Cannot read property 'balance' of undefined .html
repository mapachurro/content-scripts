<p>You may encounter this error message when you open MetaMask:</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Message: Cannot read property 'balance' of undefined</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Code: TypeError</em></p>
<p>We recommend you reset your account by following the instructions <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891">here</a>. Before you do so, consult a member of the team by <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391" target="_self">getting in touch with Support</a> — resetting an account should be avoided where possible. <strong>Make sure you have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up before you reset your account, as well as the seed phrases or private keys of any imported accounts. </strong></p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind after resetting your account is that your transaction activity history may default to none: this is because MetaMask stores your transaction history locally. Remember that all transaction history is on the blockchain, and can be <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611">consulted on a block explorer</a>. MetaMask being unable to retrieve your balance does not mean that your funds have been lost. </p>
