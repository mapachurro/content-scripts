<p><strong>The information in this article is applicable to Ethereum mainnet <em>and </em>other networks, such as BSC and Polygon. <br></strong></p>
<p>If the gas price has been set too low when attempting to carry out a transaction, this sort of error can occur:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent2">"Transaction &lt;<em>your transaction # here</em>&gt; failed! Error: [ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{"value": {"code":-32000,"message":"transaction underpriced"}}'"</p>
<p>This can happen when attempting to make a swap via a DEX (decentralized exchange) or simply when sending tokens to an address.</p>
<p>In order to successfully complete the transaction, you should issue a new transaction whilst<strong> raising the amount of gas you pay. </strong>However, before you do so, check on the relevant block explorer (e.g. <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_self">Etherscan</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/" target="_self">BscScan</a>, <a href="https://polygonscan.com/" target="_self">Polygonscan</a> etc.) to make sure you are not generating an increasingly longer queue of pending transactions. </p>

<p>Click on the 'Market' icon located above your gas details, and then hit 'Advanced':</p>

<strong>Input a comparable or slightly higher gas limit</strong> than you did for the transaction that failed</li>
<li class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Raise the <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>max priority fee</strong></span> at least <strong>10% higher (in gwei) than the <span class="wysiwyg-underline">gas fee</span> of the failed transaction </strong>

<p>Click the wallet actions button in the center of the tab bar. This will bring up a pop-up menu, where you can select the 'Send' button.</p>

<li>
<p>Input the details of your transaction, such as the recipient address and the quantity of tokens you want to send. These details should be the same as the original (failed) transaction, assuming you still want to send the same amount to the same address. Tap 'Next'. You should now see the screen below. Tap on the highlighted gas fee number:</p>

<p>This will bring up an additional menu where you'll be presented with the options to set your gas fee low, medium, or high. Ignore these and tap 'Advanced options' instead.</p>
