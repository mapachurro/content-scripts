<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
<p>In this case, start by reinstalling MetaMask on your device.</p>
<p><strong>Before you uninstall, make sure you have your Secret Recovery Phrase and seed phrases (or private keys) imported accounts). </strong>You do not need to have your MetaMask password, as you'll have to choose a new one as part of the restore process anyway.</p>
