<p>If you see the following pop-up in MetaMask:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16145491739419" alt="MetaMask unable to connect to the blockchain host" width="450" height="135"></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This means that you currently don't have access to blockchain data. MetaMask connects to services (the "blockchain host") that provide read and write access to your blockchains of choice.</p>
<p>For the convenience of MetaMask users, <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a> is configured as the default blockchain host.  Any loss of connection would likely be temporary due to a technical issue.</p>
<p>But like many features in MetaMask, which blockchain host the wallet connects to is customizable, meaning you can change it to connect to any other blockchain node, whether offered by a service or one that you run yourself.  While the Infura service is industry-leading for many important reasons (reliable up-time, ease of use), users may choose to have a backup service on standby should there be any service disruptions.</p>
