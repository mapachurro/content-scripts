<p>If you see a transaction on your account that you do not recognize at first, one of these situations will apply to you:</p>
<h2>The transaction <em>did</em> originate from you</h2>
<p>It's entirely possible that you don't recognize a transaction because you forgot you made it, or because it's part of a more complex string of transactions executed whilst you were interacting with a dapp. Using a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611" target="_self">block explorer</a>, check whether you recognize the following traits of the transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date and time</li>
<li>Recipient address</li>
<li>The dapp involved (which is listed alongside each transaction under 'Activity')</li>
<li>The value sent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The transaction is unauthorized</h2>
<p>If you're sure the transaction is not yours, check out our article <em><a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052511372" target="_self">I've been hacked/scammed</a> </em>to see our recommended next steps.  </p>
