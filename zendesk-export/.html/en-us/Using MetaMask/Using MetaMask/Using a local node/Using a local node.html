<p>Ethereum is a network of "nodes" — that is, a network of computers running similar software that connects them to the blockchain, and which, collectively, comprise the network. </p>
<p>For greater security, privacy, and read speeds, you might want to run your own node, instead of using <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4417315392795" target="_self">Infura</a> as the default provider. Running nodes also increases Ethereum's decentralization, improving the health of the network.</p>
<p>Once you have your own node up and running, you can connect MetaMask to it and use it to send requests to the blockchain and receive information back. </p>
<p>To run a node, you need Ethereum clients. Since Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake, you can no longer run a "full" node using one client. Instead, you need two: one for the execution layer, and one for the consensus layer. </p>
<p><strong>Consensus layer</strong> clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://prysmaticlabs.com/" target="_self">Prysm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io/" target="_self">Lighthouse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nimbus.team/" target="_self">Nimbus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/ethereum-2/teku/" target="_self">Teku</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lodestar.chainsafe.io/" target="_self">Lodestar</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Execution layer</strong> clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/" target="_self">Geth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu" target="_self">Besu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon#erigon" target="_self">Erigon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nethermind.io/" target="_self">Nethermind</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each client is designed with a slightly different set of priorities or target audience, and they also use different code languages. Make sure to look through to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen one, the best place to start is the official Ethereum guide to running a node: <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/</a></p>
<p>Once you have your local clients set up, you can connect to your node with the network menu in the top left corner of MetaMask:</p>

<a href="https://clientdiversity.org/">https://clientdiversity.org/</a>. 'Client diversity' describes the mix of Ethereum clients currently in use. Concentrating Ethereum nodes into a handful of dominant clients creates a centralization risk for the network, and a potentially problematic point of failure. Whilst the diversity of consensus layer clients is relatively healthy, it's recommended you consider steering away from Geth as you execution layer client, if possible.</li>
