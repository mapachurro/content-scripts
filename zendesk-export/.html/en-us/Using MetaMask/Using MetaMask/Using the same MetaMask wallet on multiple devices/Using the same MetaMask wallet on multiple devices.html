<p>One of the benefits of using MetaMask is that you can use your Secret Recovery Phrase to access your wallet on multiple computers or smartphones. You're not bound permanently to any single device.</p>
<p><strong>To access your wallet on a new device, use your Secret Recovery Phrase to <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612" target="_self">restore your wallet</a>. </strong></p>
