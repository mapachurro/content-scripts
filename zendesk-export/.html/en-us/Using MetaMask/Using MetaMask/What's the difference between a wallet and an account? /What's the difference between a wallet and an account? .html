<p>Across this support page, we refer to your <strong>wallet</strong> and <strong>account(s)</strong> as separate items. </p>
<p>The distinction is not immediately clear, but is important for understanding how MetaMask works, its structure, and what you can and can't do with wallets and accounts. </p>

<p>'Wallet' describes the MetaMask software you're using. 'Account' refers to a public-private key pair. </p>
<p>Your wallet doesn't have an address; an account within it does. Instead, a MetaMask wallet is a software tool that allows you to manage and access accounts. </p>
<p>You can derive more than one account from a Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase).</p>

<h2>What is a wallet?</h2>
<p><strong>A wallet is a client (a piece of software) with which you manage your <a href="#h_01GTYG9DPD1XA4Q8Y6A7EQZT4T" target="_self">accounts</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The confusion around web3 wallets often stems from the term itself and how it relates to our non-technological, everyday-life understanding of it. A physical wallet holds cash and cards; in web3, <strong>your wallet does not contain your assets — your accounts do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we should imagine MetaMask and other wallet software as the kind of real-world, physical 'wallet' that holds an ID card or passport. The wallet itself is simply a tool for transporting around a means of proving your identity. MetaMask, accordingly, is principally a <strong>tool for proving your identity in web3</strong>. This is why we sometimes refer to MetaMask as a decentralized identity management tool: it's a way of signing transactions and messages to demonstrate that you are the holder of the private keys of your account(s). </p>
<h2 id="h_01GTYG9DPD1XA4Q8Y6A7EQZT4T">What is an account? </h2>
<p><strong>An account is a public-private key pair derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your accounts in MetaMask are each represented by a public address</strong> (the 'public' side of your key pair), which you may have seen referred to incorrectly as a 'wallet address'. There is no such thing: there is only an account address. Confusingly, many web3 services and protocols conflate wallets and accounts. This is unhelpful, particularly when navigating support issues such as <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/13112366068251" target="_self">lost SRPs</a>, and <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612" target="_self">restoring</a> and <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4556918516763" target="_self">resetting wallets</a> and <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891" target="_self">accounts</a>. </p>
<h2>What does this mean in practice?</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don't have funds and assets in a wallet; you have them in your accounts. Your accounts, in turn, are managed using your wallet. </li>
<li>When you share an Ethereum address, you're sharing an account address. There is no such thing as a wallet address.</li>
</ul>
