Remember: MetaMask isn't like a traditional website, where you're *logging in* to a remote server. Rather, MetaMask stores your Secret Recovery Phrase, private keys, and a certain amount of information about how you use MetaMask (the 'state logs') on your local device, so that whenever you want to carry out an operation on a blockchain, your SRP and private keys are ready to be used.


In this sense, you don't *log out* of MetaMask, but you can *lock* the application, so that you'll have to re-enter your password or biometrics to log back in.
