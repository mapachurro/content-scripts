If you're looking to move tokens from the Ethereum network, or any other EVM-compatible network, back to BSC, then you're in luck:


Binance has written a [support article specifically to help you out with this](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance). Its suggests it's specifically about recovering funds sent on the wrong network, but it also covers some important general points about moving funds to BNB Smart Chain.Â 


**Keep in mind that MetaMask simply allows you to access the Binance network, and has nothing to do with how tokens work, or get transferred onto or off BSC.** For this reason, we encourage you to consult directly with Binance's support resources for all Binance-related issues.


Make sure to **ask Binance for any special requirements** before making a transaction.


If you have **any further questions** regarding Binance, please **contact the** **[Binance Support](https://www.binance.com/en/support)** team directly.
