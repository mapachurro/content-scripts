#### *Note: This article describes the process for moving assets you hold in MetaMask to the Binance centralized exchange (CEX). This is not the same thing as [moving assets from MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059408871-Sending-funds-to-the-Binance-Network-BSC-)*


If you are trying to transfer assets to Binance from MetaMask, please make sure you are following the guidelines to avoid a loss.


First of all, you have to understand that Binance is a centralized exchange that functions on a limited number of networks. **(Ethereum mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.)** So please make sure you're certain of:


* The network your tokens are currently on (the one you're sending from)
* Support for that network on the Binance exchange.



#### Warning


If you've already sent the tokens and Binance does not support the network, your funds are most likely gone for good. For further information, please contact Binance at <https://www.binance.com/en/support>**.** 



After making sure that Binance supports the network, you will need to make sure that you have funds in MetaMask for gas fees *on that network*.


Please note that gas fees are paid in the native token of the network, for example:


* ETH for Ethereum Mainnet
* BNB for Binance Smart Chain
* MATIC for Polygon.


If you don't have tokens for the gas fees, you won't be able to send the assets to the Binance exchange.


Follow [Binance's instructions here](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360046787054-How-to-Deposit-Crypto) (for the US exchange) [or here](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115003764971) (for outside the US) to obtain the specific address for the token you're depositing within your Binance account. Copy this address and paste it into MetaMask [when you are asked for the destination address.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-send-ETH-and-ERC-20-tokens-from-your-MetaMask-wallet)
