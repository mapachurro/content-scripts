#### *If you are using MetaMask in conjunction with Binance, we strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with [Binance’s documentation on the topic](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html). That said, there are some technical details you **must understand in order to avoid losses**.*


 


Specifically, **Binance is not just one platform**. It’s not even just one blockchain. When people talk about Binance, they may be referring to any one of the following:


* [**Binance**](https://www.binance.com/en), *the centralized cryptocurrency exchange*
* *Its US-based equivalent*, [**binance.us**](https://www.binance.us/en/home)
* [**The BNB Chain**](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/binance-chain-blockchain-for-exchanging-the-world-304219301536473088), (formerly Binance Chain) *the blockchain which tracks BNB*
* [**The BNB Smart Chain,**](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) (formerly Binance Smart Chain, still referred to as BSC by most) *designed to ‘bring smart contract functionality to the Binance Ecosystem’, tracks tokens that comply with the BEP-20 standard and is compatible with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks*


The methods for moving assets between these different networks vary depending on what you are trying to move, where. **Not all assets can be moved freely between all chains.**


 


What are you trying to do?
--------------------------


### Move assets between the Binance, or binance.us, centralized exchange and a wallet address via MetaMask


Recommendation: Follow [Binance’s instructions](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115003670492). 


**Note that if you withdraw BNB as a BEP2 token, it may not function as intended, for example, in dapps on the BNB Smart Chain.** In order to access this functionality, you will need to withdraw your BNB as BEP20 tokens. Additional instructions for [withdrawing here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416069050011), and [depositing to Binance here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411972525851).  
  



### Move assets between the BNB Smart Chain and another EVM-compatible network via MetaMask


Recommendation: Follow [Binance’s instructions](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance). 


**Additionally, we strongly recommend that you use official bridges when transferring tokens between blockchains.** Additional instructions for [sending to BNB Smart Chain via MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059408871) here, and instructions for [sending from BNB Smart Chain to a different blockchain](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404464724635) via MetaMask here. 


**Have you sent funds from BSC to MetaMask, but you don't see the tokens**? We have instructions for that [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059876052).
