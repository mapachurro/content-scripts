If you have sent ETC funds to your MetaMask addresses, you could try using the interfaces of MyCrypto or MyEtherWallet if they support switching to the ETC network, to see and send the ETC funds you may have in your addresses.


Alternatively, you can set up a custom RPC server in your MetaMask extension to see the balance of ETC available.


**Before proceeding, familiarize yourself with working with sidechains and custom networks through our [User Guide here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404424659995).**
