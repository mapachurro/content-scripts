#### Looking for how to import accounts into MetaMask?


This article is specifically about *connecting* accounts to MetaMask Portfolio, at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). To learn how to import (add) accounts to MetaMask, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331).



Connecting your accounts is simple, but the exact flow depends on whether it's the first time you've used the platform, or whether you already have an account (or several) connected.


If you're a new user:
---------------------


The first time you access the dapp, you'll see the option to add your MetaMask account(s) in the centre of the page. Click 'Connect MetaMask':

Once you confirm, the dapp will refresh after a brief pause, and you'll see your full crypto portfolio, encompassing the accounts you connected. You can view and manage your connected accounts at any time by heading to the settings menu by clicking the account icon in the top-right corner, and then selecting accounts:

If you already have one or more accounts connected:
---------------------------------------------------


From the dashboard, find the account selector, located next to the 'Networks' menu in the top right of the dashboard area. When you click, you'll see a list of the accounts you've already added. To add another, click the button at the bottom of this list.


Now you'll be taken to the accounts settings page. From here, click on the 'Add account' button on the right-hand side:
