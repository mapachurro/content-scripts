#### Looking for how to remove tokens in MetaMask?


This article is specifically about managing displayed assets in the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard, available at [portfolio.metamask.io](https://portfolio.metamask.io/). For information on displaying tokens in MetaMask, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031). For specific details on removing tokens from MetaMask, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058451852). 



The MetaMask Portfolio dashboard automatically identifies the assets in your account(s) and displays them in your assets list. You can remove a token or NFT from your assets list if you no longer want it included.


For tokens, you 'Hide'; for NFTs, you mark as 'Suspicious'. 



#### Note


**Hiding tokens or NFTs does not affect ownership**; the actual balance in your account, as recorded on the blockchain, remains unchanged. Following these instructions hides them in your dashboard.





Tokens NFTs


1. On your 'Tokens' view, find the token you want to hide.
2. When you mouseover the token, three vertical dots appear on the far right. This is the 'Token actions' menu; click it to continue.
3. Select the option to 'Hide'.
4. Confirm your choice in the menu that appears, and the token will no longer be visible amongst your 'Tokens' holdings.

1. Toggle the 'NFTs' view by flicking the switch on the left-hand side.
2. Locate the NFT you want to add to the 'Suspicious' list. When you mouseover, you'll see an ellipsis labelled 'More options'.
3. Click 'More options', and then 'Suspicious':

Now you'll be able to select additional NFTs to add to the 'Suspicious' list simply by clicking on them, or, if it's just the one you want rid of, click 'Mark as suspicious' in the bar at the bottom of the screen.



Unhiding tokens and NFTs
------------------------


Hiding assets of both kinds is completely reversible.


To unhide tokens, go to your 'Tokens' view and click on the 'More' button, next to the 'Networks' selector, on the right-hand side. From there, click on ' View hidden tokens'. Click on the 'Token actions' menu, next to the token you want to unhide, and select 'Unhide'.
