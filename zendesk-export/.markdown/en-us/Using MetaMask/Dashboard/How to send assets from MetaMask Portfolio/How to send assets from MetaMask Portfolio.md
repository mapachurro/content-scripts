You'll only be able to send tokens that MetaMask Portfolio has detected in your selected account. If the token you want to send is not displayed, you could try [refreshing your balances](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324578936347) or [importing the token](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324697607835).
5. **If you're sending tokens, input how much you want to send.** An estimate of the tokens' dollar value is displayed in the input field to help you ensure you send the correct amount.
