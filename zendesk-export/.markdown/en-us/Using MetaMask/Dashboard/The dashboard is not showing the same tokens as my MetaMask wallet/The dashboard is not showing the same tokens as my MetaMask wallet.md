**The MetaMask wallet and MetaMask Portfolio are separate** **software** and do not communicate directly with each other on the backend.Â 


Here's some points to keep in mind:


* [Adding a token to MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031) does not mean it is automatically displayed in MetaMask Portfolio's dashboard, and vice versa.
* If a token isn't appearing in your dashboard, it may be because it is not on a supported network, or isn't a supported token on one of those networks. (Currently supported networks include Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, OP Mainnet, Arbitrum, Fantom, and Linea). See [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/10587744991131) for further information about adding tokens.
* If you see a token in MetaMask but not in your dashboard, try adding it using our instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324697607835).
* If you see a token in your dashboard but not in MetaMask, add it by clicking the three dots next to the token and then 'Add to MetaMask', or by using [one of these methods](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031).
