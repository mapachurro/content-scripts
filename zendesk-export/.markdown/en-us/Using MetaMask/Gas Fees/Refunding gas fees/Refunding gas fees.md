[*Gas fees*](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227) (also known as transaction fees) refers to the cost of carrying out a transaction or executing a contract on Ethereum (and many other networks). This fee is consumed by the parties running the network in order to process a transaction (that can either succeed or fail). It is the cost of computation, and is not charged or collected by MetaMask.


**Due to the nature of the blockchain, transaction fees cannot be refunded!**
