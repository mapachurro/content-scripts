**What is MetaMask?**
=====================


**Public blockchains like Ethereum are the next evolution of Internet databases, and MetaMask is the next evolution of the browser.**


MetaMask is a web browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Ethereum private keys. By doing so, it serves as a wallet for Ether and other tokens, and allows you to interact with decentralized applications, or *dapps*. Unlike some wallets, MetaMask keeps no information on you: not your email address, not your password, and not your Secret Recovery Phrase or other private keys. You retain all power over your crypto-identity.

**Brave**

After adding MetaMask Extension, you’ll return to your browser page. MetaMask will appear on your browser. You may click on it to open MetaMask.







Firstly: **do not download MetaMask from anywhere other than the official app store** appropriate to your device/OS. Cloned versions of MetaMask are out there that are programmed to record your Secret Recovery Phrase as soon as it's generated. To avoid falling victim to these scams, make sure you download the official MetaMask app from the app store on your device, and not from any other source.




**iOS**

1. Open the App Store and hit the search button in the bottom right. Input MetaMask into the search bar.


![Install MetaMask iOS](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/9915602462491)


2. Either click 'Get' or tap on the name of the app to see more details. Complete the usual App Store download confirmation process.
3. Once installed, open the app and follow the prompts to create your wallet.
4. Back up your Secret Recovery Phrase somewhere safe and offline!





**Android**

1. Open the Play Store and search for "MetaMask". **The official MetaMask app looks like the screenshot below. Be VERY CAREFUL that you don't install a fake MetaMask app! Look for the one with 10M+ downloads.**


![Install MetaMask Android](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/9915891139227)


2. Tap 'Install' and wait for the process to finish.
3. Once installed, open the app and follow the prompts to create your wallet.
4. Back up your Secret Recovery Phrase somewhere safe and offline!







Alternatively, you could also access each browser's extension store and search for MetaMask. Whatever you prefer! 


Configuring your privacy settings
---------------------------------


When installing the MetaMask extension, you'll be able to adjust privacy settings one-by-one to ensure the app is set up according to your privacy preferences. 


To do this, simply hit the 'Advanced configuration' button in the wallet set-up process. Here you can toggle/configure settings including:


* Phishing detection
* Incoming transactions
* Additional token price information from third-party sources
* The [default RPC provider](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/5378119120667)
* Token autodetect
* Batch account requests
* Custom IPFS gateway.

Don't worry if you're unsure during setup: once your wallet is up and running, you can access the same settings at any time in *Settings > Security & Privacy*. 


### **Extension permissions**


When adding MetaMask to your browser, you may ask why you’d have to approve an extension to **“read and change all your data on the websites you visit”**. Get ready, the answer is technical:


In order to enable dapps (decentralized applications) to access the blockchain, MetaMask needs to inject a [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) JavaScript object into each page. By doing so, **it will not change the website**, but merely allows it to access the network. For a fuller explanation of this, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12412707939611). 


If you are still not convinced, a good way to experiment and manage your browser is to sandbox your [MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289672-Sandboxing-MetaMask): create a [separate browser profile](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12174759849371) so that MetaMask is only installed there. This will let you get used to MetaMask and Web3 in an environment that's separate from your existing web identity.


That said, MetaMask is safe for browsing. Welcome — you're joining over 30 million MetaMask users all over the world!
