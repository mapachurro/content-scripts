When trying to [get support for MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391), **always**be wary of who you're communicating with. A reliable rule of thumb is that **if anyone asks for your Secret Recovery Phrase, they are trying to scam you**. 


**If you aren't sure whether or not something or someone is legitimate, ignore it**. To check whether something is genuine, get in touch with us via the 'Start a Conversation' button on our [Support homepage](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us) and we will advise.


### MetaMask representatives will only ever contact you via:


* **Email**, concerning [open tickets](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4453556284571), from the domains *@metamask.io* or *@metamask.zendesk.com*. If you haven't already given us your email to create a support ticket, we do not have it — remember [MetaMask does not ask for your email to create a wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212-MetaMask-is-a-non-custodial-wallet#:~:text=MetaMask%20doesn%27t%20store%20any%20data%20about%20the%20wallet.%20Everything%20you%20see%20is%20in%20your%20browser%20or%20your%20mobile%20app%20at%20a%20local%20level.%20There%20are%20no%20email%20addresses%20associated%20with%20accounts.%20There%20is%20only%20a%20Secret%20Recovery%20Phrase%20(seed%20phrase)%20that%20is%20given%20once%20and%20cannot%20be%20changed%20or%20reset.). If your email does not come from one of these addresses, ignore it; scammers have been known to target people with open tickets asking for Secret Recovery Phrases. We will never do this. Other common scam emails may involve asking you to follow a link to ['verify' or 'confirm' your account](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6286050620955), often with a sense of urgency. See here for more information: [I received an email claiming to be from MetaMask. Is it legit?](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12683145255835)
* Through our [**Community** platform](https://community.metamask.io/). As the rules at the top of our Community page detail, **we will never DM you offering support**. The [MetaMask subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/) is an extension of our Community and is also moderated by team members. However, as on any other platform, **we will never DM you on Reddit**.
* Through the **chat** accessed through the 'Start a Conversation' button on our [Support landing page](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us). This is our main channel for support communication.



#### 'Start a Conversation' button not loading?


It may be because of ad blockers or other browser features. See our article for more information: [I can't access the 'Start a Conversation' button on the Support page](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/5973459712283)



MetaMask Support also has a [verified Twitter account](https://twitter.com/metamasksupport?lang=en), which is primarily to share important information to help out you and fellow users. **MetaMask will never contact you about your Support case on Twitter**.


### Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways MetaMask will *not*contact you:


* Discord
* WhatsApp
* Facebook
* Telegram
* Twitter
* Text/SMS
* Instagram


Any group that you find on Telegram, WhatsApp, or Instagram that claims to be an official MetaMask group should be considered at best a fan club, and at worst an attempt at social engineering with the goal of stealing peoples' crypto-assets.
