### If you are interacting with sidechains or custom networks, we highly recommend you read our user guide [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404424659995-User-Guide-Custom-networks-and-sidechains).


Â 


If you get the error "Internal JSON-RPC error" while trying to interact with other networks, try the following:


* Ensure the network has been added correctly. See our [article on adding networks](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612) to find out how to do this.
* Ensure you have enough native tokens from that network to pay for gas.
* Ensure you are using the latest version of the app or the extension.
