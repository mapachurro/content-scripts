MetaMask can access many more networks than just Ethereum mainnet: you can add any EVM-compatible network. 


The initialism RPC stands for remote procedure call, a set of protocols that allow a client (such as MetaMask) to interact with a blockchain. 



#### Adding via Chainlist


For an easy way of adding networks to MetaMask, go to [chainlist.wtf](https://chainlist.wtf/), where you can connect MetaMask and add networks with only a few clicks. See our [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058992772) for more information. 



Also, please note that **adding a network on one device does not mean it will appear on another device** when accessing the same account. If you add it on Extension, it will not automatically be added to your MetaMask Mobile app, and vice versa.


Custom networks will also need to re-added if you uninstall the browser extension or mobile app (after which you'd need to [restore your wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612) using your Secret Recovery Phrase).

On both Mobile and Extension, you can easily add several prominent networks with just a tap. These include:
