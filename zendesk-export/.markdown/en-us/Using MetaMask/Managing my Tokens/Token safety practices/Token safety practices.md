### Keep the following token safety practices in mind on the decentralized web:


* **Anyone can mint a token and name it any way they like.** This means there are many malicious tokens disguised as popular tokens, so double-check that the token you're about to swap is the one you mean to swap. One way to ensure this is to [verify the token address.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059683451)
* **Risk of loss:** token prices fluctuate, so the value of a token could drop dramatically after you acquire it. This means that before you acquire a token, you need to do some research. One thing to consider is the longevity of the project or asset: has it been around for a significant amount of time, or is it something that appeared out of nowhere and is skyrocketing in value?



#### Scammer Spotlight: Rugpulls


Traditional scams such as pyramid schemes have made their way into the decentralized economy, and are often referred to as [**rugpulls**](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407169552667): when the creator(s) of a token hype up their project and quickly invest a lot of liquidity into the token in order to create eye-catching growth, only to pull all value out of the token once they reach their goal value, leaving investors who didn't know the "dump" was coming with nothing. Simply put, **do your due diligence and only invest in projects that you trust.**



* Some projects **do not have customer support.**This is due to the decentralized nature of the ecosystem: if a project runs based on a set of programmatic protocols, there may be no one keeping track of user accounts, problems, etc. In such cases, look to see if the project has a community on GitHub, Discord, Slack or another platform where you may be able to find more information.
* **A common practice in the ecosystem is *airdropping.*** Again, this often happens around the launch of a project, when the project's proponents are trying to generate interest — the 'airdrop' itself consists of gifting any number of tokens to any number of Ethereum wallet addresses. This means you could end up with tokens that you don't know about; even in this case, exercise due caution if you intend on transferring, spending, or cashing out the tokens. Just because you didn't pay for a token, and someone dropped them into your wallet, doesn't mean you should blindly use them. Make sure you understand the token and what you're going to do with it.



#### Featured Phishers: Airdrop Scams


Airdrops have been around for a long time (in blockchain time, that is), and while they have plenty of legitimate uses, they can be used to artificially create interest in a non-meritorious project (see the **Rugpulls** section above) or, more nefariously, can be used to phish unwary users.


If you see some tokens in your wallet that you didn't buy, [say on Etherscan](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611), don't immediately jump to swap them; do some research first. A common setup for an airdrop scam is that the tokens won't swap — instead, the token will reroute the user to a website where they have to enter personal information, even their Secret Recovery Phrase, in order to allegedly cash out their tokens.


**Don't give your Secret Recovery Phrase to anyone or any website, even one that is promising you tokens or cryptocurrency in return.**

We recommend you keep a close eye on the tokens associated with your account(s); for more information on adding tokens, and managing them, see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031). **If you do have scam tokens airdropped to your account, just leave them there**; as we've indicated, often it's trying to do something with the tokens that ends up hurting you.
