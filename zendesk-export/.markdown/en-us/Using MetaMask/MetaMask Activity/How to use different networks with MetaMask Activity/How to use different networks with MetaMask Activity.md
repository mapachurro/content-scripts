You can now use MetaMask Activity to review and troubleshoot your transactions on numerous EVM-compatible networks, including:


* Polygon
* Binance
* Avalanche
* Arbitrum
* Palm
* Fantom
* Cronos.


You can only view transactions on **one network at a time**.


You can manually select the network for which you'd like to check your transactions by using the network selector, located next to the account address:

Please note that MetaMask Activity will behave differently depending on whether you have *connected your wallet* or whether you've *looked up* an account:


* **If you've connected your wallet, MetaMask Activity will detect your currently selected network in MetaMask** and automatically display transactions on those networks — so in a lot of cases, you shouldn't have to switch manually. If your currently selected network is unsupported by MetaMask Activity, Ethereum mainnet will be selected by default.
* **If you've searched by account address (or ENS name), MetaMask Activity will default to Ethereum mainnet**. So if you want to view that account's transactions on a different network, you need to switch.
