### Known Issues


#### MetaMask doesn’t open when I try to connect, or another crypto wallet opens instead


If you run into a situation where MetaMask won’t open, or a different web3 or crypto wallet extension opens instead when attempting to connect to MetaMask Activity, follow these steps to try and resolve the issue:


1. Verify that MetaMask is installed in your browser, your Secret Recovery Phrase is imported, and that you are able to unlock your wallet using your password. *If you’re having problems unlocking your wallet, [start here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405451730331); if you need to find your SRP, [start here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/13112366068251)*
2. Verify that you’re using one of the browsers listed below.
3. Disable all other wallet extensions (**but make sure you know your passwords and Secret Recovery Phrases for each wallet before you do!**)
4. Create [a separate browser profile for each crypto wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12174759849371-How-to-use-multiple-MetaMask-wallets)
5. If you’re still running into problems, start a conversation with a member of our Support team by going to [support.metamask.io](https://support.metamask.io) and clicking on the big blue button labelled “Start a Conversation”.


### MetaMask Activity is supported on the following browsers:


#### Google Chrome


#### Mozilla Firefox


#### Safari (MacOS and iOS)


* *MetaMask Extension is not available in Safari; however, MetaMask Activity can still be used by entering the ENS name or public address of the account you’re interested in. For steps to find and copy a public address from your wallet,* [*see here*](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289512)*.*


 


It is likely that MetaMask Activity will work as expected on many other browsers, as well, especially those that are Chrome-based, such as Microsoft Edge. Brave Browser, while being Chrome-based, sometimes requires additional configuration in order to work properly with MetaMask; for more on this, [see here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360038596792).
