Security Snaps introduce a new tab in the transaction prompt, allowing Snaps to provide important security info about a transaction you’re about to submit.


Introducing Security Snaps
--------------------------


Security Snaps take your transaction journey to the next level by enabling Snaps to offer essential transaction insights, such as (but not limited to!):


1. **Phishing database checks**Know if the recipient address is linked to any known phishing databases, giving you an extra hand in figuring out whether you might be interacting with a malicious address.
2. **Transaction simulations**A Snap could help you determine whether a transaction might succeed or fail and predict any state changes by simulating the transaction locally, or by using AI.


Getting started with Security Snaps

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------




**Are all Snaps equipped with insights about my transactions?**

Not every Snap offers insights on your transactions. Check individual Snap descriptions to see if they make use of insights. When installing a Snap, you can also see whether it provides transaction insights by checking the permissions it requests:

**Are there any privacy concerns when using Security Snaps?**
Different types of Snaps access different information based on the permissions granted at installation. Any user data you share with a third-party-developed Snap will be collected directly by Snaps developers; MetaMask does not have access to this data. Only install Snaps from developers that you trust, and always check the privacy policy and terms of use of a Snap before installation.
