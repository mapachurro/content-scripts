In order to pay for transactions on OpenSea, Rarible, or any other Ethereum mainnet NFT trading platform, you need to have enough ETH in your wallet to [pay for gas](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227/preview/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6NDQwNDYwMDE3OTIyNywiZXhwIjoxNjI4MTA1MTE4fQ.XdtusXXEe7XNKJ79xgMfxknuAXklY5-RlItIsb2t_B0). That said, there are certain circumstances where a platform, such as OpenSea, **will require you to pay in WETH**, which stands for "Wrapped ETH". It is a different form of ETH, created to be more compatible with newer smart contract functionality. **Please consult OpenSea's documentation** [here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500006315941-What-are-gas-fees-on-OpenSea-) for more information on paying gas fees on the platform.
