#### Managing your NFTs with MetaMask Portfolio


MetaMask Portfolio is a standalone app that complements MetaMask and help you manage your tokens (and NFTs!). To see your NFTs, simply:


* Launch [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/)
* Sign in with MetaMask to the address you want to see
* Click on the "NFTs" tab

All the NFTs attributable to (owned by) the accounts that you link to the dapp should be displayed automatically. Please note that not all NFTs may display correctly — this is to do with how we're able to retrieve data about them for third-party sources. We are, however, working to maximize compatibility, with the goal of making sure the vast majority of NFTs will be displayed in the dapp.


 




NFTs are displayed under **the NFT tab.** Please remember that some NFTs will not show up on the mobile app, **or may not show up correctly.**


The easiest way to display your NFTs is to turn on the app's NFT autodetect feature. See the [FAQs](#h_01FX57WQCNFY5GKFYR8YYW70D5) for how to do this.


If autodetect doesn't find your NFTs, you can add them manually using these steps:


1. **Find the NFT's *address.*** On OpenSea, for example, on the NFT's page under **Details**, there is a blue hyperlinked value labelled 'Contract Address'. If you click on this, it will take you to the contract's address on Etherscan; at the top-left of that page, there should be an icon labelled 'Contract', and to the right, a long string of letters and numbers. This is the address of the contract that created your NFT. Click on the 'copy' icon to the right of the address, and you'll have it on your clipboard.

2. In MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'NFTs' tab in wallet view, scroll down and tap on the 'Import NFTs' link.


![MetaMask find NFTs mobile](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250780513307)
3. Paste the NFT's address from your clipboard into the 'Address' box.
4. **Find the NFT's *ID*.** A collectible's ID is a unique identifier since no two NFTs are alike. Again, on OpenSea this number is under 'Details'. Make a note of it, or copy it onto your clipboard.
5. Paste the ID into the box marked 'ID' in MetaMask Mobile, tap on the 'Import' button, and your NFTs should appear under the NFTs tab.




#### Displaying NFTs on Ethereum mainnet


If you have automatic NFT detection enabled, MetaMask will automatically fetch any NFTs you have on **Ethereum mainnet**. NFTs on other networks are supported, but you need to [add them manually](#01GWME6RMRJS85VEE4RHHZR9Y2).


If you're on Ethereum mainnet and have NFT autodetect turned on, head to the 'NFTs' tab on your homepage. MetaMask will automatically display any detected NFTs.


![MetaMask find NFTs extension](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250765080859)


If you don't have NFT detection turned on, you'll see a prompt under the NFTs tab that will take you to Settings > Security & privacy to turn it on. Head there to toggle it.


![MetaMask autodetect tokens settings extension](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250780523163)


Head back to your homepage and the NFTs tab, and your collection should appear.


In future, if an NFT isn't detected automatically, you can manually refresh by clicking the 'Refresh list' button at the bottom of the NFTs tab.


#### Adding NFTs manually


In some cases, you may want to add an NFT manually. This could be, for example, because you have NFTs on EVM-compatible chains that MetaMask supports, like Polygon or BNB Smart Chain.


To do this, head to the NFTs tab, scroll down and click 'Import NFTs', then input the requested information.


![MetaMask import NFTs extension](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/18335019857947)


You'll be able to find these details on OpenSea by connecting your wallet and finding the NFT's details on your profile.

**FAQs**
--------




**How do I turn on NFT detection?**

### Extension


When you switch to the 'NFTs' tab on the extension homepage, if you haven't already turned on NFT detection, a prompt will appear. Follow the link to bring up the security & privacy settings menu where you can turn on autodetect.


If you want to head there manually, simply go to Settings > Security & privacy.


![MetaMask autodetect tokens settings extension](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/17250780523163)


Please note: **NFT autodetect is only available on Ethereum mainnet**. The option will not appear in settings if you have a different network selected. 


### Mobile


When you switch to the 'NFTs' tab on the app homepage, if you haven't already turned on NFT detection, a prompt will appear. Follow the link to bring up the security & privacy settings menu where you can turn on autodetect.


Please note: **NFT autodetect is only available on Ethereum mainnet**. The option will not appear in settings if you have a different network selected. 


Otherwise, follow these steps:


1. Find the settings menu by tapping the gear icon in the bottom right of the app.
2. Find 'Security & Privacy' and scroll until you see 'Autodetect NFTs'.
3. Flick the switch to turn on autodetect. **Note that 'Enable OpenSea API'** (directly above in the menu) **must be turned on as well, otherwise the NFT autodetect switch will be greyed out**.

Most NFTs should now automatically appear under the 'NFTs' tab of your wallet.





**What NFT types are supported?** 

You can add both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs to MetaMask on any network.


At the moment, sending NFTs is only supported for ERC-721 tokens.





**"You are not the owner of this NFT" error**

If you receive a message telling you that you are not the owner of the NFT, please be sure that you are trying to add the token to the right MetaMask account. Also, please verify on the network's block explorer that you own the NFT at your MetaMask wallet address. See our [guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611-How-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer) if you're unsure how to check your wallet on a block explorer.





**How do I verify that I actually have the NFT?**

[Search for your MetaMask account address on the block explorer](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611-How-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer) and review your transactions to see if the transfer of the NFT to your account has been successful. Alternatively, search for the NFT's contract address and check that its location matches your account's address, and that the transaction is complete.


You can see all of the transactions performed with your NFTs by clicking "ERC-1155/ERC-721 Token Txns" tab on the block explorer. If you do not see the NFT here, contact the sender.





**"Personal address detected. Input the collectible contract address."**

This error appears if you have pasted in an account that doesn't have the format of an NFT smart contract. Follow the instructions under the *Mobile* tab above to locate the NFT's contract address, and paste this in instead.
