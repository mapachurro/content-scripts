### As discussed in a Consensys blog post on [Axie Infinity](https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/to-infinity-and-beyond-the-growth-of-axie-infinity/), the Ronin **sidechain** has become very popular, and MetaMask wants our users to be able to interact safely and reliably with the Ronin chain.



#### Important warning - loss of funds possible


Axie Infinity runs on the sidechain Ronin, and not Ethereum mainnet. For more information, see [here](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain).



Here are some tips for interacting with the Ronin network using MetaMask:


* If you use the Ronin wallet address for sending assets directly from MetaMask, simply changing the "ronin" prefix into "0x" or vice versa, **you will lose any assets you send.**
* The transfer of assets from MetaMask to the Ronin wallet and vice versa **must be made with the Bridge app** (<https://bridge.axieinfinity.com/>).
* If the assets were transferred directly from MetaMask and not using the Bridge app, **there is no way we can reverse the transaction**, as the nature of blockchains does not allow it.
* If the assets have been sent through the bridge but are not reflected in the Ronin wallet after a reasonable amount of time, **you should address this with Ronin's customer support, as this is not a MetaMask product**.
* As always, **never give your seed phrase or secret recovery phrase to anyone, even if you believe that person to be Customer Support from MetaMask, Axie Infinity, or Ronin.**
