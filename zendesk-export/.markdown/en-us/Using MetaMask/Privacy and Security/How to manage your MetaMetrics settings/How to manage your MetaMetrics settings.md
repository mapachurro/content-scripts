For a fuller discussion of MetaMetrics, our most updated blog post on the topic is [here](https://medium.com/metamask/metametrics-a-refresher-on-metamasks-analytics-system-78d725cb9a75); simply put, **MetaMetrics is an opt-in analytics platform that aims to collect information on non-sensitive user events to help us improve the software for MetaMask users.**


MetaMask is a product that, above all else, values our users' privacy and agency: MetaMask is a tool built to empower you, not to profit off of you. While many software products, with the best of intentions, have built-in metrics collection tools that are not visible to the user, MetaMask's metrics collection is completely voluntary. 


That said, opting into MetaMetrics doesn't affect your experience negatively at all--and in fact, it increases the likelihood that features you want or need will be prioritized. By opting in, users help us answer questions such as:


* What features do people use the most?
* What parts of the application do people run into the most trouble with?
* Where do people drop off when completing certain actions?


To those of you who do opt-in: thank you for helping us make MetaMask better!
