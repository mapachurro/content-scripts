#### Note:


* An important message from the MetaMask team regarding this issue can be found [here](https://community.metamask.io/t/restored-metamask-no-coins-are-showing/878/107?u=jacob.cantele).
* For basic information on your Secret Recovery Phrase in MetaMask, see our user guide [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107).



Assuming you are using the correct Secret Recovery Phrase (which can restore multiple accounts) or private key (which can restore only one account when [imported](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331)), it is impossible to restore the wrong account(s). Check to see if any of the following apply to you:


If you are encountering this problem, the most common reasons are: 


1. **The Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) you currently have is not the one that restores the account you are looking for.**In other words: you have the wrong SRP.
2. **The account you are missing was a secondary account created under the SRP you currently have.**


To check if that is the case, use <https://danfinlay.github.io/mnemonic-account-generator/> to generate 10 to 100 accounts and check if the missing accounts are in that list. (Bear in mind that the generator will produce account addresses *without*the 0x at the start, so copying an address from elsewhere that *does*have the 0x prefix will produce no matches.)


If the account you're looking for is a secondary account, you can recreate it in MetaMask by following the instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271).
3. **The SRP you have was originally generated by a different wallet provider.**


If you think this could be the case, try restoring your account using that wallet to check if you get access to the missing account.
4. **The missing account was imported using a private key.** 


This is what is known as an [imported account](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289932-What-are-imported-accounts-). In this case, the only way to access the account is to reimport it using the private key.
5. **The SRP was written down wrong or is being entered incorrectly when restoring.**


One frequent problem is poor handwriting when writing down the SRP; another is writing the words in the *wrong order.* The words must be in the order in which they were originally presented.
6. **The SRP is actually restoring the account, but what is missing is the custom tokens that need to be re-added.** 


You can follow the steps [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-and-Custom-Tokens-in-Metamask) to re-add them.
