MetaMask uses passwords in a way that you may not be used to. This mainly has to do with the fact that [MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212) (also called non-custodial, though we're phasing out this term); it's **not** a conventional cloud-based app where we keep track of your username and password.


**You** keep track of your [Secret Recovery Phrase](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107), and each time you [restore your wallet using your Secret Recovery Phrase](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612), ***you set the password for that specific instance of MetaMask.***  
**This means that if you use different passwords for each instance** (Mobile, Extension, Extension on different computers or browser profiles), **you need to remember which password you used for each instance.**
