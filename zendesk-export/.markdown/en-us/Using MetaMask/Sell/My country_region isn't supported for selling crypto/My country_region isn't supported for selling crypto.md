Whilst we want to make MetaMask's features accessible to as many people around the world as possible, selling crypto in MetaMask is not universally available.


This is because the companies we partner with cannot operate in every jurisdiction, as their operations are affected by varying laws and regulations. 


If you have ETH that you want to exchange for fiat currency and your country/region is not supported, you will have to do so on an exchange. This means sending the tokens manually to the exchange platform of your choice. 


When you do so, please bear in mind:


* **You will use some of your ETH tokens in order to pay gas fees for the sale transaction**.
* **You need to ensure the exchange supports the network and tokens you're using**. Be sure to check the exchange's support documentation to verify if they support Ethereum mainnet and ETH.


For details on how to send tokens from MetaMask, please check our article on [sending tokens from MetaMask.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488931-How-to-send-ETH-and-ERC-20-tokens-from-your-MetaMask-Wallet)
