MetaMask Staking is currently only supported on **Ethereum mainnet**.



Staking with MetaMask is a fairly straightforward process. Follow the steps below to get started and receive rewards:


1. Head on to [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/) and click on 'Stake'. You can select which token you want to stake: **ETH** or **MATIC** (MATIC staking is currently available only to users outside the United States).
