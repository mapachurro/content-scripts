Usually, when you intend to connect MetaMask to a dapp in a desktop browser, a pop-up will appear in MetaMask asking you to confirm the connection.


**If nothing happens, the most common reason is because you have more than one browser-based wallet installed and active**. **You'll need to disable other wallets in order for MetaMask to work properly.**


To do this, head to your browser's extension manager and find the on/off toggle next to the other wallet's extension. It should look like this:

**Once you have disabled other wallets, reload the page**. 


Depending on your browser, managing extensions can work a little differently. To find the correct page, copy the appropriate link into your address bar:


* **Chrome**: chrome://extensions
* **Brave**: brave://extensions
* **Firefox**: about:addons
* **Edge**: edge://extensions


If disabling other wallets doesn't work, get in touch with Support via the 'Start a Conversation' button on our homepage.
