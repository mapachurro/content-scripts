If you are using MetaMask to access a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) such as Pancakeswap or Uniswap, and you see the error message "**Permissions request already pending please wait**", please try these workarounds, which should help you to reconnect:Â 


* **Disconnect from the site** using the method explained [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059535551) (available for both Mobile and Extension), then return to the dapp and click 'Connect wallet'. Afterwards, retry connecting to the dapp.
* If reconnecting using the above steps doesn't work, you could also try reinstalling MetaMask and [restoring](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612). **Please ensure you have your [Secret Recovery Phrase](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys) and the seed phrases of any imported accounts safely backed up before uninstalling your wallet.**
