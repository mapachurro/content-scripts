If you try to swap using MetaMask Swaps and your swap fails, you could see this error message on the block explorer:


![EXPIRY_PASSED.png](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/11992991758235)


This happens either when:


* You waited too long in MetaMask to perform the swap, or;
* You submitted the swap right as the quotes were about to refresh.


Retry the attempted swap as normal, and you should no longer encounter the same error. If you do, [get in touch with Support](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391).Â
