Answers to the most common Uniswap issues can be found on their [FAQ site](https://uniswap.org/faq).


Some additional tips:


* Make sure you have enough ETH for the gas fee in order to complete the swap.
* Make sure you both APPROVE and then SWAP (two transactions). If you only approved, it will not be completed.
* After the swap completes, **if you do not see the tokens you swapped for**, you may need to simply [add the token(s) to your MetaMask in order to see them.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-See-Your-Tokens-in-Metamask)
* If you are getting failed transactions, make sure the gwei is set high enough, and the gas limit is above 250,000.
* If your MetaMask activity feed is inaccurate or stuck, meaning you are unable to speed up, cancel or send new transactions, try [these instructions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251-How-to-speed-up-or-cancel-a-pending-transaction).
* Never give your Secret Recovery Phrase to anyone or any site. If Uniswap asks you for this information, then you are not on Uniswap, you are on a scam site or app.
