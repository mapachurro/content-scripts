#### Please note:


This article is for MetaMask swaps performed with the swap button within our app or extension.  **For all other swap inquiries, please contact the third-party swap system you used, as they will have a better understanding of their system's intricacies, nuances, and issues.**



MetaMask Swaps is not available on every network.  If it is available on a network, the button will allow you to proceed. The team is investigating options on a path forward for additional networks. If and when that time comes, you will automatically see it reflected in the app and extension.

If you are on a network on which Swaps is available, but are unable to click the Swap button, try restarting your browser, or try a different network connection entirely. Sometimes toggling networks (switch from one network back to the network you were using) helps.
