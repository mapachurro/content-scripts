Decentralized blockchains are immutable, meaning the data they contain cannot be changed. When the transaction is confirmed and shows as successful, **there is nothing we can do to revert/cancel it.** Usually, when the transaction is confirmed, it's final, and is added to the next block. 


**You can only cancel a transaction while it is still pending.**


**We cannot revert a transaction that is already completed.**


What you can do is to check with the receiver or receiving app to see if they could do anything on their side (i.e. return your funds via a new transaction).
