What is a nonce?
----------------


The term 'nonce' is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of '**n**umber used **on**ly on**ce**': every single transaction you *send* from your MetaMask wallet has one, and the number (starting with 0 for the first transaction you send) increases in increments of 1.


Each transaction's nonce is an identifier that ensures your transactions are processed by the network in the correct order, preventing ['double spend' scenarios](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-nonce/).


In MetaMask, adjusting the nonce can be useful if you need to [speed up or cancel pending transactions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251).


How do I customize the nonce when sending a transaction?
