Every single transaction on the blockchain is assigned a unique **transaction ID**, also known as a *transaction hash*. Often, the terms can be found with the abbreviations *tx* or *txn* substituted for transaction.


Explaining the cryptography behind this number would require extensive explanation. However, for our purposes, we can simply understand this hash number as a condensed form of the transaction's data — in other words, details such as the addresses involved, the timestamp, and the quantity of tokens exchanged. 


Locating the transaction ID is straightforward, and varies depending on the platform you're using to access MetaMask:




Extension Mobile


As soon as you submit a transaction to the network, it will appear in the *Activity*tab of your account, detailing whether you were sending or receiving. 


Simply click on the transaction in question:

This should display the interface below, at which point you will notice the convenient ***Copy Transaction ID*** option. This will copy the ID to your clipboard, ready for however it's needed.

Alternatively, and if you want to see more detail, you could also select ***View on block explorer**,*which will take you to the appropriate block explorer page for the network you're using. Here, the transaction ID is referred to as the transaction hash. 




To access the transaction ID in mobile, first we need to be able to view the transactions. There are two ways to do this depending on how you want to narrow them down: 


### Option 1: View transactions by token type


Accessible from the wallet view, which displays all the token types previously added or held by the wallet, this method is useful if you want to distinguish between tokens. 


From here, tap the relevant token type to bring up its transactions, and select the one you're looking for. Scroll down to see your activity, and then tap on the transaction to view its details:

### Option 2: Transaction history


Tap the clock icon in the tab bar to view all activity:

After finding the transaction you want to investigate, tap it to bring up its details.


Whichever method you use, you'll be presented with basic information and the transaction status. At the bottom you'll see an option to view on Etherscan*:*


![MetaMask view transaction activity mobile etherscan](https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/16922306801947)


Select this to open Etherscan within the app's native browser. You'll then be able to easily locate the transaction ID listed as 'transaction hash' on Etherscan.


As with Extension, the block explorer links will update according to the network you're using at the time — e.g. if you're using Polygon, the app will show a link to Polygonscan.
