If you get an error about a token having already been added when trying to add a token, you can solve it through the following process:




1. Right-click on the MetaMask Extension
2. Select 'This Can Read and Change Site Data'
3. Select 'On All Sites' instead of 'When You Click the Extension'

You may also need to close and re-open your browser, or try a different internet connection entirely.


Note that this only applies to Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave), and not Firefox. MetaMask Extension on Firefox is configured to request this permission as a requirement of use.


If you continue to experience issues, [please contact MetaMask Support](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391).
