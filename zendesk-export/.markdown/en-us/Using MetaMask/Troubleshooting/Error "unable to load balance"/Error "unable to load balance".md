This error message can be prompted because:


* You are using the wrong token address. Check [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059683451) for guidance on how to find it.
* MetaMask needs to be [updated to the latest version.](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060268452)


If these steps do not solve this issue, try reinstalling the app. Make sure you have everything backed up before proceeding: your Secret Recovery Phrase, private keys (for any imported accounts), and passwords.


***Do not*** uninstall the app if you don't have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up and safely recorded somewhere, otherwise you will permanently lose access to your wallet. Since MetaMask is a [self-custodial](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212) (non-custodial) wallet, we won't be able to help you regain access in such cases. After reinstalling, you'll need to [restore your wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612) using your Secret Recovery Phrase.


For each old account that you had in your original installation, you must re-add it; see [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271) for details.


If the token you are looking for is not found using the Search method, then you will need to [add it as a Custom Token](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031).
