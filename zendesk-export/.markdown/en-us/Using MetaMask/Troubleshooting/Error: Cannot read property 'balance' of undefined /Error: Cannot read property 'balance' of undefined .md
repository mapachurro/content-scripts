You may encounter this error message when you open MetaMask:


*Message: Cannot read property 'balance' of undefined*


*Code: TypeError*


We recommend you reset your account by following the instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891). Before you do so, consult a member of the team by [getting in touch with Support](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391) — resetting an account should be avoided where possible. **Make sure you have your Secret Recovery Phrase backed up before you reset your account, as well as the seed phrases or private keys of any imported accounts.**


One thing to keep in mind after resetting your account is that your transaction activity history may default to none: this is because MetaMask stores your transaction history locally. Remember that all transaction history is on the blockchain, and can be [consulted on a block explorer](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611). MetaMask being unable to retrieve your balance does not mean that your funds have been lost.
