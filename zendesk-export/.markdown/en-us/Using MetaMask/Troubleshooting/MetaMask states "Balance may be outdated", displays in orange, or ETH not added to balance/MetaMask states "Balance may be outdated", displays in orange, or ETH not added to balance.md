If you see your balance in orange, it might be outdated due to a permission or network connectivity issue:

To fix this issue, try the following:




Chromium-based browsers: Chrome, Brave, Edge Firefox


1. Right-click on the MetaMask Extension icon
2. Select **'This Can Read and Change Site Data'**
3. Select **'On All Sites'**

These instructions will look similar across Chromium-based browsers: i.e. Chrome, Edge, and Brave.




The permission to access data on all sites is enabled by default on Firefox, since it's a permission which MetaMask automatically requests for core functionality.Â 




You may also need close and re-open your browser, or try a different internet connection entirely.


If you continue to experience this issue, please [contact MetaMask Support](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391).
