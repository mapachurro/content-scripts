If you have completed a transaction successfully but you've noticed a discrepancy between the amount confirmed in your MetaMask wallet and the amount you received (and displayed in the [block explorer](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611)), please check if the token you received is subject to a "tax".


As an example, a 10% tax applies on SAFEMOON transactions, and OKTA transactions are subject to an 8% tax.  



For further details please refer to the token issuer documentation.
