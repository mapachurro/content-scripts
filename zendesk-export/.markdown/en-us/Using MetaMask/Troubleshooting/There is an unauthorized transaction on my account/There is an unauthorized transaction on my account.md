If you see a transaction on your account that you do not recognize at first, one of these situations will apply to you:


The transaction *did* originate from you
----------------------------------------


It's entirely possible that you don't recognize a transaction because you forgot you made it, or because it's part of a more complex string of transactions executed whilst you were interacting with a dapp. Using a [block explorer](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611), check whether you recognize the following traits of the transaction:


* Date and time
* Recipient address
* The dapp involved (which is listed alongside each transaction under 'Activity')
* The value sent.


The transaction is unauthorized
-------------------------------


If you're sure the transaction is not yours, check out our article *[I've been hacked/scammed](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360052511372)*to see our recommended next steps.
