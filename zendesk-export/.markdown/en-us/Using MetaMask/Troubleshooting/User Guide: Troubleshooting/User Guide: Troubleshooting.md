If MetaMask isn't working the way you expected, there are some steps you can take on your own that often solve problems, without having to create a support ticket. Here are some of our top fixes:


* Restart your browser, or force close the mobile app and reopen.
* Restart your computer or mobile device.
* [Lock and unlock MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360053412451).
* If your problem relates to a specific transaction, check the relevant block explorer for the network you're using, such as [Etherscan](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611). Block explorers are a wealth of information and offer much greater detail regarding the where, when, what, and who of transactions.
* Make sure you're [running the latest version](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060268452) of MetaMask.
* Search the [Community Forums](https://community.metamask.io/) and this Knowledge Base for similar problems.
* **We do not recommend [resetting your wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4556918516763) or [resetting an account](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891) unless one of our agents advises you to.**
* Remember, [MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212-MetaMask-is-a-non-custodial-wallet), which means we **cannot rescue compromised wallets.** We also **cannot** **reverse transactions**, as this contradicts the immutability of blockchain.
* If you're experiencing a problem with a third-party platform, like a [token swapping app](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405506066331) or blockchain videogame, **reach out to their support team first**.
* If you're looking for help, don't spam our Support team by asking the same question on multiple channels. This will only delay the reply. If you have a live conversation open, your browser will remember your history. If you have a live ticket (email correspondence) with our Technical Support team, see how to check on the status of your ticket [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4453556284571).
* Have you waited long enough? Blockchain is fast, but not instantaneous. How low did you set your gas? Are you transacting on a layer 2 chain that requires you to wait before removing funds?
* Did you use a bridge? See our [article](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4836913606683) for additional guidance.


If you still need help, open a ticket following our instructions [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058969391-How-to-contact-MetaMask-Support).
