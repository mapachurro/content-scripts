If it's how you've set up your browser, MetaMask Extension is automatically updated when a new version is released.


While most browsers encourage users to get updates automatically (as do we), users can enable or disable auto-updates on some browsers.


Here’s how:


### Chrome-based browsers (Chrome, Brave)


Google Chrome and similar browsers, such as Brave, don’t (explicitly) support users to disable [extension auto-updates](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/autoupdate). Some users explore [workarounds here](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/l3zOZeO-5-M), but they're complex and we would not encourage our users to explore this route.


### FireFox


1. In the search bar, type: 'about:addons'
2. Click on the MetaMask extension tile:
