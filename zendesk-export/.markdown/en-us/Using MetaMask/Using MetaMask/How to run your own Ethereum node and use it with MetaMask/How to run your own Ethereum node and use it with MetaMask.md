If you are interested in learning more about how to run your own Ethereum node, the official [ethereum.org instructions](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/) are a good starting point. 


Once you have your node up and running, consult our article [here](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015290012) on how to connect MetaMask to it.
