If you encounter issues while trying to use MetaMask on Brave (such as an error saying MetaMask is not installed, even though it is), **you need to disable Brave's wallet as the default**. MetaMask does not work correctly if other browser extension-based wallets are installed and active.


1. Click on the hamburger (three horizontal lines) icon in the upper right hand corner and choose the "Settings" menu:

2. Using the menu on the left-hand side, choose the "Web3" section of Settings
3. Change "Default Ethereum wallet" to "None"
4. Restart Brave.
