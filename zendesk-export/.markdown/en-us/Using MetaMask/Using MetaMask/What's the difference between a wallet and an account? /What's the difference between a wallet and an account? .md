Across this support page, we refer to your **wallet** and **account(s)** as separate items. 


The distinction is not immediately clear, but is important for understanding how MetaMask works, its structure, and what you can and can't do with wallets and accounts. 



#### tl;dr


'Wallet' describes the MetaMask software you're using. 'Account' refers to a public-private key pair. 


Your wallet doesn't have an address; an account within it does. Instead, a MetaMask wallet is a software tool that allows you to manage and access accounts. 


You can derive more than one account from a Secret Recovery Phrase (seed phrase).



What is a wallet?
-----------------


**A wallet is a client (a piece of software) with which you manage your [accounts](#h_01GTYG9DPD1XA4Q8Y6A7EQZT4T).**


The confusion around web3 wallets often stems from the term itself and how it relates to our non-technological, everyday-life understanding of it. A physical wallet holds cash and cards; in web3, **your wallet does not contain your assets — your accounts do.**


Instead, we should imagine MetaMask and other wallet software as the kind of real-world, physical 'wallet' that holds an ID card or passport. The wallet itself is simply a tool for transporting around a means of proving your identity. MetaMask, accordingly, is principally a **tool for proving your identity in web3**. This is why we sometimes refer to MetaMask as a decentralized identity management tool: it's a way of signing transactions and messages to demonstrate that you are the holder of the private keys of your account(s). 


What is an account?
-------------------


**An account is a public-private key pair derived from your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP).**


**Your accounts in MetaMask are each represented by a public address** (the 'public' side of your key pair), which you may have seen referred to incorrectly as a 'wallet address'. There is no such thing: there is only an account address. Confusingly, many web3 services and protocols conflate wallets and accounts. This is unhelpful, particularly when navigating support issues such as [lost SRPs](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/13112366068251), and [restoring](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289612) and [resetting wallets](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4556918516763) and [accounts](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891). 


What does this mean in practice?
--------------------------------


* You don't have funds and assets in a wallet; you have them in your accounts. Your accounts, in turn, are managed using your wallet.
* When you share an Ethereum address, you're sharing an account address. There is no such thing as a wallet address.
