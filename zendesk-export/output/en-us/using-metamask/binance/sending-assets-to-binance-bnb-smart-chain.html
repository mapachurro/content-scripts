<p>If you're looking to move tokens from the Ethereum network, or any other EVM-compatible network, back to BSC, then you're in luck:</p>
<p>Binance has written a <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-recover-crypto-transferred-to-the-wrong-network-on-binance">support article specifically to help you out with this</a>. Its suggests it's specifically about recovering funds sent on the wrong network, but it also covers some important general points about moving funds to BNB Smart Chain.Â </p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that MetaMask simply allows you to access the Binance network, and has nothing to do with how tokens work, or get transferred onto or off BSC.</strong> For this reason, we encourage you to consult directly with Binance's support resources for all Binance-related issues.</p>
