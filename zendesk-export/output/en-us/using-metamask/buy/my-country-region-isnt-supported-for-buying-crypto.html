<p>Whilst we want to make MetaMask's features accessible to as many people around the world as possible, buying crypto in MetaMask (also referred to as on-ramp) is not universally available.</p>
<p>This is because the companies we partner with cannot operate in every jurisdiction, as their operations are affected by varying laws and regulations. </p>
<p>If your country/region isn't supported, you may still be able to get tokens into your wallet through other means. One route, for example, could be to <strong>b</strong><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">uy tokens on a centralized exchange (CEX) and deposit them into MetaMask</strong><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.

Also, bear in mind that this route, like on-ramps themselves, will usually require KYC (know your customer) steps, such as proving your identity, and availability may also vary by region. CEXs also differ from MetaMask in that they are custodial — meaning you don't have control of your accounts' <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107" target="_self">private keys</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">You could also arrange a P2P (peer-to-peer) deposit into your wallet by sending simple transactions.</span></p>
<p>Regardless of the method you choose, please do your own research before handing over any money, and make sure the platform you're using is safe. Always <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432" target="_self">practise good web3 security habits</a>.</p>
