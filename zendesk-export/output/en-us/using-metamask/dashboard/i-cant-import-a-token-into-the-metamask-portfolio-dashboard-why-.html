<p>Most popular tokens will be detected automatically. See how to import (add) tokens <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/8324697607835" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p>If you're wondering why you see different tokens listed in MetaMask and MetaMask Portfolio, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/10554670875291" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p>If you can't add a token, it will be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each supported network in MetaMask Portfolio has its own token list. If you own a token on these lists, you can add it. If the token isn't on this list, it won't be available. </li>
<li>The token may be supported in MetaMask Portfolio, but not on the network that you're trying to add it on. </li>
<li>MetaMask and MetaMask Portfolio work differently. In MetaMask, you can import any token by inputting details manually, so long as they adhere to key token standards like ERC-20. In MetaMask Portfolio, you can only add the tokens from our list. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you're attempting to add a token and none of these circumstances apply, contact Support by hitting the 'Support' button in the bottom left of MetaMask Portfolio. </p>
