<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">One of the most useful features of MetaMask Mobile is its built-in browser.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">This enables you to use your MetaMask wallet to interact with dapps directly on your smartphone, without having to access a desktop browser. <strong>You</strong> <strong>must access dapps using the in-app browser in MetaMask</strong>, rather than any other browser available on your device. On other mobile browsers, you won't be able to connect to dapps using MetaMask. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">In this guide, we'll use the classic blockchain video game Cryptokitties as an example, but the steps are essentially the same for any web3-enabled website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you've selected the account you want to use for accessing dapps. To do this, tap on the account selector and pick the account you want to use:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Open the browser by tapping the browser icon in the tab bar:</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Open a new tab using search bar, or by clicking the magnifying glass icon, and navigate to the website or app you need:</p>

<p>As with most web3 applications, Cryptokitties asks to connect to your wallet. Here's the real convenience of the MetaMask Mobile browser: <strong>you've already selected your account</strong>, so it's all queued up and ready. With a tap, you can sign in with that account and start playing:</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Keep in mind that the browser is not as fully-featured as a standalone mobile browser application such as Chrome or Firefox. There may be things that don't work. But if you're trying to mint an NFT on the go, or check out a new web3 project that you might want to spend some time on later, it's just the right solution.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Also, <strong>keep track of what applications you give permissions to</strong>, and <strong>be careful which permissions you give</strong> them. (Though dapp connections are much more innocuous than their potentially dangerous relative, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683" target="_self">token approvals</a>.)
