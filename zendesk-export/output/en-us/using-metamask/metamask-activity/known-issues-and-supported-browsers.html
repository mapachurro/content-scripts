<h4><span style="color: #666666;">MetaMask doesn’t open when I try to connect, or another crypto wallet opens instead</span></h4>
<p>If you run into a situation where MetaMask won’t open, or a different web3 or crypto wallet extension opens instead when attempting to connect to MetaMask Activity, follow these steps to try and resolve the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify that MetaMask is installed in your browser, your Secret Recovery Phrase is imported, and that you are able to unlock your wallet using your password. <em>If you’re having problems unlocking your wallet, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405451730331"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">start here</span></a>; if you need to find your SRP, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/13112366068251"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">start here</span></a></em>
</li>
<li>Verify that you’re using one of the browsers listed below. </li>
<li>Disable all other wallet extensions (<strong>but make sure you know your passwords and Secret Recovery Phrases for each wallet before you do!</strong>)</li>
<li>Create <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12174759849371-How-to-use-multiple-MetaMask-wallets">a separate browser profile for each crypto wallet</a>
</li>
<li>If you’re still running into problems, start a conversation with a member of our Support team by going to <a href="https://support.metamask.io"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">support.metamask.io</span></a> and clicking on the big blue button labelled “Start a Conversation”.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span style="color: #434343;">MetaMask Activity is supported on the following browsers:</span></h3>
<h4><span style="color: #666666;">Google Chrome</span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #666666;">Mozilla Firefox</span></h4>
<h4><span style="color: #666666;">Safari (MacOS and iOS)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<em>MetaMask Extension is not available in Safari; however, MetaMask Activity can still be used by entering the ENS name or public address of the account you’re interested in. For steps to find and copy a public address from your wallet, </em><a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289512"><em><span class="wysiwyg-underline">see here</span></em></a><em>. </em>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It is likely that MetaMask Activity will work as expected on many other browsers, as well, especially those that are Chrome-based, such as Microsoft Edge. Brave Browser, while being Chrome-based, sometimes requires additional configuration in order to work properly with MetaMask; for more on this, <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360038596792"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">see here</span></a>. </p>
