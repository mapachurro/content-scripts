<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Are there any privacy concerns when using Security Snaps?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Different types of Snaps access different information based on the permissions granted at installation. Any user data you share with a third-party-developed Snap will be collected directly by Snaps developers; MetaMask does not have access to this data. Only install Snaps from developers that you trust, and always check the privacy policy and terms of use of a Snap before installation.</div>
