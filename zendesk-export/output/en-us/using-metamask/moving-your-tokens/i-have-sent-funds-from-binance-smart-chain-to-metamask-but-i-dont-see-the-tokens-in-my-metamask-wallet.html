<p> </p>
<p>To summarize the situation this article is covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've sent funds from BSC to MetaMask but the tokens are not in your MetaMask account.</li>
<li>Binance has confirmed that the transaction was successful and that the withdrawal address is correct.</li>
<li>You used the BSC network and sent funds as BEP-20 tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, we need to confirm the transaction was successful. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://bscscan.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">BSCScan</a>
</li>
<li>Enter your MetaMask <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488791" target="_self" rel="undefined">public address</a>
</li>
<li>Click on "BEP-20 tokens" as per below and check if you find the transaction.</li>
<li>Click on "token" and check if you find your "missing" tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p>If you found the transaction and the tokens: great news, it will be an easy fix! All you need to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Add the BSC network to MetaMask</strong>

<p>Please note that MetaMask is set by default to connect to the Ethereum Mainnet, not the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network.</p>
<p>If you want to move the tokens to Ethereum mainnet, you can use MetaMask Bridges at <a href="https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge" target="_self">portfolio.metamask.io/bridge</a>.
