<p><em>Please note that when resetting your wallet as described here, <strong>any accounts (addresses) that do NOT ORIGINATE from your phrase will not be recovered afterwards</strong>. These imported accounts, either hardware wallet or imported via private key, are NOT INCLUDED under the Secret Recovery Phrase and will need to be <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489271" target="_self">re-added manually</a>. Please be sure to verify that you have the private key/seed phrase for any imported accounts before proceeding with the reset process.<br><br></em></p>
<p>When resetting your password for your MetaMask wallet, you will need your <strong>12-word secret Secret Recovery Phrase</strong>. If you do not already have your Secret Recovery Phrase saved someplace safe, please make sure to read <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015290032" target="_self" rel="undefined">How to reveal your Secret Recovery Phrase.</a></p>
<p><strong>Before trying these steps, confirm that you have your Secret Recovery Phrase with you, as you will not be able to reset your password otherwise and will risk being locked out of your wallet.</strong></p>
