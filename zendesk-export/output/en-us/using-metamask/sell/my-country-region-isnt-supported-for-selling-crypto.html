<p>Whilst we want to make MetaMask's features accessible to as many people around the world as possible, selling crypto in MetaMask is not universally available.</p>
<p>This is because the companies we partner with cannot operate in every jurisdiction, as their operations are affected by varying laws and regulations. </p>
<p>If you have ETH that you want to exchange for fiat currency and your country/region is not supported, you will have to do so on an exchange. This means sending the tokens manually to the exchange platform of your choice. </p>
<p>When you do so, please bear in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You will use some of your ETH tokens in order to pay gas fees for the sale transaction</strong>. </li>
<li>
<strong>You need to ensure the exchange supports the network and tokens you're using</strong>. Be sure to check the exchange's support documentation to verify if they support Ethereum mainnet and ETH.</li>
</ul>
