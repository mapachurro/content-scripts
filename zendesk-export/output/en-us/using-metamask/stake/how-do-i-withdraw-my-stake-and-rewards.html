<p>With MetaMask Staking, you can withdraw staked ETH and MATIC from any of our supported staking protocols (Lido, Rocket Pool, and Stader Labs).</p>
<p>You can choose between two options to get your ETH or MATIC back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using MetaMask Staking to interact with the staking protocol’s withdrawal mechanism</li>
<li>Swapping your liquid staking tokens on a decentralized exchange or service such as MetaMask Swaps.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use rETH (Rocket Pool's liquid staking token) as the subject of most of our screenshots. Regardless, please note that the steps apply to all four liquid staking tokens.</p>
<p><em>Withdrawing stETH, stMATIC or MaticX does require an extra step, however; scroll to see it or <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923#01H050KCYE4DC27M1GZ0NEHE15">click here</a>.</em></p>

<p>In MetaMask Staking, a ‘standard’ withdrawal is one that uses the staking protocol’s withdrawal mechanism.</p>
<p>To withdraw using this method, click the three dots in the top-right of your holding, and click ‘Withdraw’.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444383164443" alt="MetaMask staking" width="400" height="345"></p>
<p>From here, input the amount of your liquid staking token that you’d like to withdraw, and then click ‘Withdraw’.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444375639579" alt="MetaMask staking" width="376" height="378"></p>
<p>Now you’ll see a screen with ‘Withdraw’ and ‘Swap’ options; select ‘Withdraw’ and then click ‘Review’ to proceed:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444421032091" alt="MetaMask staking" width="376" height="449"></p>
<p>You’ll now be able to view the details of your proposed transaction: the amount of the liquid staking token you want to withdraw, and how much ETH or MATIC you’ll receive when the process is complete. When you’ve reviewed the details of the transaction, hit ‘Confirm’.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444422674715" alt="MetaMask staking" width="375" height="369"></p>
<p>You may now be asked for up to two approvals in your wallet. The first is to approve interacting with the liquid staking token’s contract and the second is to approve the transaction.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444425049883" alt="MetaMask staking" width="344" height="536"></p>
<p>Once you’ve approved the transactions in your wallet the screen will update to a ‘Transaction in progress’ message, indicating that your transaction is waiting to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Once your transaction is confirmed your withdrawal will begin to process, and the screen will update differently depending on the protocol you're using:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rocket Pool</strong> withdrawals will update to ‘Transaction complete’, and should generally be <strong>immediately available</strong>. Once confirmed, your ETH will be visible in your portfolio.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.metamask.io/hc/article_attachments/14444433934491" alt="MetaMask staking" width="328" height="223"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lido and Stader Labs</strong> withdrawals will update to 'Withdrawal request started' and <strong>provide an estimated date for when your withdrawal will be ready</strong>. The date is dependent on the provider and their withdrawal processing queue. Withdrawals require an additional step to claim your tokens, so please check out the section below.</p>

<div class="note note--info">
<p>Applicable to Lido (stETH, stMATIC) and Stader Labs (MaticX) withdrawals only.</p>
</div>
<p>If you're withdrawing staked ETH or MATIC from Lido, or staked MATIC from Stader Labs, at this point you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for your withdrawal to complete.</li>
<li>Return to MetaMask Staking and claim your stake and rewards once the withdrawal is ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your withdrawal request has started, you can visit the 'Your holdings' section of the Stake page to get the latest information on your withdrawal request and when it’ll be available. The date provided is an estimate and dependent on the protocol and their withdrawal processing queue. Come back regularly to see if your withdrawal is ready.</p>
<p>Each Lido stETH and stMATIC withdrawal request is also represented by an NFT: the NFT is automatically minted for you by Lido when you start your request — check your MetaMask Portfolio 'NFTs' tab to see the NFT. When the request is ready to claim, the NFT's image will be updated. </p>

<p>Once your withdrawal is ready to claim the estimated date will change to 'now' and the 'Claim rewards' button will become available. Click on the 'Claim rewards' button to continue.</p>

<p>Now you'll see the details of your withdrawal, including the amount and the estimated gas fee. Click 'Confirm' to proceed:</p>

<p>After a short 'Transaction in progress' screen, the screen will update to confirm that the staked ETH plus rewards will now be in your wallet, and, therefore, visible in your portfolio. For Lido withdrawals, your withdrawal NFT will also be burnt at this point.</p>

<p>If it’s your first time using MetaMask Swaps, click ‘Approve’. You’ll be asked to approve the MetaMask Swaps contract in your wallet and set a <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579">spending cap</a>.</p>

<h4 id="01GXR6TDY4DADXASZ6S4MMNBZ2" class="callout__title">What is an approval?</h4>
<p>Approvals grant dapps (and, by extension, underlying smart contracts) the ability to access and transfer a specified number of a given token from your account. Read more about approvals <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683">here</a>.</p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How long until I get my tokens?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Exchanging liquid staking tokens back for ETH or MATIC using MetaMask Swaps will be immediate, and complete in the time it takes for the swap transaction to be confirmed by the network.</p>
<p>Withdrawals using the staking protocol’s withdrawal method vary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rocket Pool withdrawals will generally be <strong>immediate</strong>. Withdrawals are fulfilled with liquidity deposited to the protocol that is yet to be staked by a validator. If there is insufficient liquidity available, you will not be able to withdraw and you will need to submit your transaction again.</li>
<li>Lido and Stader Labs withdrawals will generally require waiting <strong>a few days to a few weeks</strong> after starting a withdrawal to claim your ETH or MATIC. The delay is because the provider requires your underlying ETH and MATIC to be unstaked from the Ethereum protocol before it will be available for you to claim. The withdrawal dates shown in MetaMask Staking are estimates and the exact date is dependent on the provider and their withdrawal processing queue.</li>
