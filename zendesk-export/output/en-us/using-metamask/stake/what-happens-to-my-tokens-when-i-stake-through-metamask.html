<p>When you stake ETH or MATIC through MetaMask, we route your transaction (minus any fees) to your selected staking provider. Your tokens are deposited into their protocol, and you receive <em>liquid staking tokens</em> directly from them in return. These tokens, such as Lido’s <em>stETH</em> and <em>stMATIC</em>, Rocket Pool’s <em>rETH</em>, or Stader Lab's <em>MaticX</em>, represent your proportional claim to tokens in their protocol.</p>
