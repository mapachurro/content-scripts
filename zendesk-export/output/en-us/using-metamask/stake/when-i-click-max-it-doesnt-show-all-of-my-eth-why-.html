<p>All transactions on Ethereum cost a small amount of ETH to pay for <strong>gas</strong>, which covers the cost of processing each transaction. For a full explanation of how gas works on Ethereum, see <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227" target="_self">here</a>. </p>
<p>In order to make sure you have enough gas to complete your transaction, we subtract a small amount of ETH when calculating the “Max” amount you can stake.</p>
<p>If you’re seeing your max as “0”, you’ll need to add more ETH to your wallet or wait for gas fees to go down before you can stake.</p>
