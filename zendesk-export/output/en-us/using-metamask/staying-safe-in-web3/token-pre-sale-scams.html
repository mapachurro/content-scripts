<p>Token pre-sales are periods during which organisations offer quantities of new tokens for investors to buy early. The 'pre' references the fact that these sales typically come before the <em>actual </em>sale — generally referred to as an initial coin offering, or ICO.</p>

<p>None of the information here is meant to recommend or dissuade you from getting involved with token pre-sales or ICOs. Those decisions are entirely yours. All we aim to provide is an overview of how this subject area can be used by scammers to steal your funds.</p>
</div>
<p>These events naturally attract a lot of interest from speculators: if you jump on the right token at a bargain price, its price may skyrocket. Step 3: <em>profit</em>?  </p>
<h2 id="01GQMWKMY9WPWP3C2XMB1J5D47">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Scammers have been known to exploit ecosystem participants for their fear of missing out (FOMO) on these potentially astronomical financial gains. It's as simple as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The scammers set up a</strong> <strong>front end, </strong>usually a dapp to which they want you to connect your wallet. The level of sophistication here can vary: don't assume a site is safe to interact with just because it <em>looks </em>professional and legitimate. Web development is so accessible nowadays that even the least ambitious scammer could put together a relatively sleek-looking dapp with minimal time investment. </p>

<h4 id="01GQMWKMY98FDR8AEBDF7QNQDV" class="callout__title">I'm not stupid: why do they think I'd fall for this?</h4>
<p>One of the main tactics scammers employ to get around your cynicism is by capitalizing on <strong>hype</strong>. Often, the scam token will be associated with a big name, whether directly associated with web3 or not. A brief web search will tell you that scammers have repeatedly tried to create a buzz around a purported Amazon token. What they want you to think is clearly: <em>why wouldn't you want to get in early on a token launched by one of the world's biggest retailers?!</em></p>
<p>With your judgement clouded by FOMO, they hope you'll buy in regardless of any doubts your more detached, rational self should have. </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<strong>They publicize the pre-sale</strong>, directing you to the site/dapp where the sale is to happen. They may try to drum up interest by paying for promoted pages on search engines or socials. Often these will attempt to:
<ul>
<li>Appear legitimate by pushing out articles that mimic the design and domain names of trusted news sources</li>
<li>Attract traffic by closely copying the appearance legitimate token pre-sale sites, but using a slightly different URL out of necessity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The site prompts you to buy the token</strong>. This will generally be a token approval, enabling the dapp to access and move tokens of a certain type from your wallet, up to a given cap (chosen by you). </li>
</ol>
<p>The token involved will usually actually exist: anyone can create a new token with any given supply and name. It's just that, quite often, it will either not be the <em>actual </em>(most likely similarly-named) token it pretends to be, or it will be designed to substantiate some fictitious scenario in which they'd like you to invest (e.g. the fake Amazon token). </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="01GQMWKMY9H7N1XJ1J7J1J7GFR">How can I stay safe?</h2>
<p>Fake pre-sales depend on eliciting a few main behaviours from you. Here's how you should act to avoid falling into the traps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Verify the pre-sale is being offered on a legitimate site. </strong>Mistaking a scam for a real site is one of the main ways this attack rears its head. Always double-check the URL before you make any transactions. Check the social channels of any project/organization to make sure you follow the correct link. </li>
<li>
<strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Make sure you understand the transaction before you sign it. </strong>Token approvals involve giving a dapp access to move (including withdraw) a given type of token from your wallet. If you don't understand what token approvals are and look like, do your homework <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6174898326683" target="_self">here</a> and <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6055177143579" target="_self">here</a>. It can be the difference between losing a bit of money and losing all your money.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't recklessly FOMO into a pre-sale. </strong>Make your purchases based on rational thought, not emotion. Don't let your FOMO get the better of you. </li>
</ul>
