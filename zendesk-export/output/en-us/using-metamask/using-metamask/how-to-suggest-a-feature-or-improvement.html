<p>We are always interested in hearing how our users would like to use and improve MetaMask.</p>
<p>Please post your request to our <a href="http://community.metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community forum</a>. You can also access this in-app if you're using MetaMask Mobile. Simply tap the gear icon in the tap bar, scroll down, and then select 'Request a feature'.</p>

<p>Before you submit a new request, have a look to see if someone else hasn't already suggested it — in this case, it's better to upvote theirs rather than add another.</p>
<p>Rest assured there's a lot of behind-the-scenes development that goes on at MetaMask, but we're keen to hear and integrate user requests wherever feasible. Posts on the Community requests page are regularly considered by our developers.</p>
